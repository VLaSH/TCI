"Telling Your Story with Video","Shoot to Edit","Getting to know your camera. Familiarity with editing software. Shooting basic footage","<p>The aim of this course is to create a 3-minute short-film that can be shown proudly to family and friends, uploaded to popular internet websites or simply - in the course of its production - serve as a solid foundation for advancement in video movie-making.</p><p>Knowing your equipment well is a first step toward becoming an accomplished filmmaker. In this regard, there are certain functions and menus common to most camcorders that will come in handy to know more about. If you haven't already done so, spend time going through the manual that came with your camera to familiarize (or re-familiarize) yourself with their location and purpose. A thorough review of your camcorder's documentation will be the best route to follow, but short of that, here's a summary of the basics you'll need:</p><p>Recording: This is the place to start and the upper right corner of your viewfinder is the place to look. Here is where to check your time-code, making sure that the numbers are moving (i.e. 001...002...etc.). Between shots glance to this position to ensure that your footage is running in continuous fashion. It's always good, too, to record at least 5 seconds before and after each take, to ensure that everything you want to work with has been captured and will be available when the edit stage of your film-making process rolls around. Lastly, record 10 seconds of blank screen at the beginning and end of your take, to safely buffer the footage you are about to capture. </p><p>When filming, It's always important to check that 'Rec' is displayed in the top right corner of your camera's viewfinder, as well. There's nothing worse than thinking you've captured a scene, when you really haven't or return home to discover shots of your feet walking the pavement. Once while filming clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops for my film, 'Shots that Bind,' I missed all the action because I thought I had pressed the red button on my camcorder to record, only later to discover that record was already on and I had mistakenly - and disappointingly - ended my coverage of the whole situation.</p><p>White balance: This is a function setting on your camera used to compensate for different colors of light being emitted by different sources of light. You will need to white-balance your camera whenever you encounter a new lighting situation. I needed to make this camera adjustment when making the clips for this lesson, for example, when I moved from artificial, indoor lighting to natural outdoor illumination. Note, too, in these clips that a difference in color of light exists between that captured in the room of the male actor and that recorded when filming in the female actor's environment. Though both situations were white-balanced, each exhibits a very different mood. The man's room has a warm feel to it, while that of the woman is dark and gray, resulting in a more foreboding atmosphere.</p><p>Some camcorder models offer their user an icon-driven menu indicating the type of lighting and corresponding setting to be made. With these, the process of white-balancing is only a button-press away. Other camcorders give you the option of automatically making this setting selection or, conversely, doing it yourself (manual setting). The latter is accomplished by holding up a white object in front of the lens, filling the viewfinder with its image and then locking-in this calibrated adjustment. Either way, don't ignore the white-balance segment of your pre-shooting preparation 'ritual'.</p><p>Gain Shift: This adjustment should follow next on your pre-shoot checklist. It is usually called into play when filming in low light; such as that dominating the room of the female actor shown in our clip. Two additional situations requiring gain adjustment include filming in saturated light and in bright sunlight. Be aware though, as gain is increased, so too is the level of signal noise produced - a factor that can dramatically reduce the quality of your recorded imagery.</p><p>Automatic Exposure (AE): Locate this function next on your camcorder. When making adjustments to this setting, I've always found that it is hard to do better than my camera's own auto-exposure system - when filming under 'normal' conditions, that is. However, if you do need to adjust for different contrasts (e.g. day, night, sports, etc.) my recommendation is to experiment with the auto-exposure setting on your camcorder to see what works best for you.</p><p>Special Effects: Be cautious when it comes to any special effects adjustments on your camera. In fact, I recommend avoiding this camcorder function altogether, unless you're absolutely certain of their impact to your film. Alternatively, add any special effects you may want in the editing stage of your production. That way, you can be sure of the feel you're going to have in your final product.</p><p>In practice, shooting and editing video go hand-in-hand. For this reason, we'll begin to practice the two as a unified process, right from the start. That is, you'll capture footage with your camera, download it to your editing software on computer and arrange the film clips on a time-line.</p><p>To help you with the software side of things, I recommend the one-month, free trial download of Ulead VideoStudio 11.. For those unfamiliar with basic video editing, tutorials of this software are available on the internet. If you're a Mac user using imovie, you'll find a equally helpful tutorial at the Apple website.</p><p>Before you actually get your camera out and start shooting, though, I have provided a short video clip and a few essential film and camera techniques for you to consider. Watch and read carefully in order to get a better understanding of the kinds of clips I want you to shoot - to tell your story digitally for this course. In this clip, you will see a variety of camera perspectives represented - close-ups, medium-distance shots, and long or 'wide' shots, as the latter two are synonymously known.</p><p>Describing these camera views further, a close-up shows only a part of the subject, with an eye on greater detail. With close-up shots, little or no surrounding context is revealed to the viewer. In the examples provided here, such include things like a person's face and the cell-phone messages we see.</p><p>A medium-distance shot shows both the subject and its immediate surroundings. Examples of this in the clips include the male and female actors seated on the sofa, sending and receiving SMS messages.</p><p>A long or wide shot shows all of the subject in relation to its overall surroundings. For example, a head-to-foot view of the male actor getting off the bed, leaving the room and driving the scooter are all representative of a long or wide-shot camera perspective. So, too, is the shot of the female character walking out of the house, suitcase in hand.</p><p>These three shot types are used for specific reasons and bring different moods to the production. For example, as an establishing shot that begins your film, using a close-up of the SMS or the reaction on the face of your character waiting for that SMS, gives a completely different 'feel' to your film than if you were to use a long shot of your character driving the scooter or sitting on the bed. All of these filming perspectives are good. It's using your creative vision to find the where, when and how each will work most effectively for you - that will bring to your film the visual impact you most want.</p><p>Another very important strategy in film-making is to shoot as many cutaways as possible. A cutaway is a common video production feature used to add visual variety to your work and to hold the audience's attention. In the clip provided, an example of this would be the close-up of the SMS message. It could also be what the subject is seeing as he walks out the door. What I most want to emphasize here, is that although such cutaways may not be critical to the overall message of your film, having as many as possible will ultimately be of value when it comes to editing the whole of your movie.</p><p>When filming, remember to compose your picture as a painter would. Look at your shot to be sure it includes all that you want and excludes those elements which are not of importance to your movie. Be sure, too, that all that you do included, is framed in a pleasing (aesthetic) manner. In this respect, do as you would when framing a still photograph. One pathway to good composition is the so-called, 'Rule of Thirds' guideline. To follow it, simply divide (mentally) the frame (viewfinder) into thirds - vertically and horizontally. The resulting four intersections of lines represent excellent locations for placement of subject and action. </p><p>A further point of importance is to orient peoples' eyes near the top line of this Rule-of-Thirds arrangement - centering the head on either the left or right vertical line, facing inward, as illustrated below. And, even if cropping of the head occurs, the overall result will be a pleasing visual arrangement with professional flair. Of course for creativity's sake, rules can be occasionally bent or broken. This one, though, should be mastered before moving in any other direction.</p><p>High-quality imagery results from a rock-steady camera position. For the most stable shots, consider using a tripod or similar device. When such isn't available, brace yourself against an immovable object - a wall, for instance. Also recommended is to activate the image stabilizer of your camera via its function menu. </p><p>Personally, I like to mix my shots, sometimes using a tripod - as with the male subject on the scooter. At other times, I film with a hand-held camera, as with the female actor in the car reading the card. Obviously it was impossible to set up a tripod in the automobile, but I did brace the camera on the top of the front seat to aid its stability.</p>",1
"Telling Your Story with Video","Camera Techniques - Script Your Story","More on Shooting Sequences - Techniques, Composition, Light, Sound.  Scripting your Story - Using the 3-Act Structure.","<p>More on Shooting Sequences - Techniques, Composition, Light, Sound.  Scripting your Story - Using the 3-Act Structure.</p><p>Now that you've taken your first successful steps in shooting to edit a professional-style digital movie, let's go further.</p><p>This week you are asked to shoot and edit one more sequence before writing your script. By applying the camera and film techniques learned in Lesson 1 and the new ones in Lesson 2 as well as the experience of shooting these sequences you will have an excellent understanding and a clear vision of what it will take to write your script and feel more confident to shoot and edit it. Your professional looking final cut will entertain, inform, and impress your audience. That being said lets continue with learning more film techniques.</p><p>Part 1</p><p>Lighting is an essential component to make your film stand out. The richer and more appropriate your light source, the greater look and feel your film with have. The intensity and direction of light will affect your subject and scene in a different way.</p><p>Whether using natural light out-of-doors or artificial illumination inside, shadows and lighting the location should be one of your major considerations during your video shoot. This is especially true when it comes to peoples' faces. Light falling from the side will emphasize facial bumps and ridges. Similarly, harsh light from above will make eyes appear sunken. Backlighting, be it natural or artificial, falls into this same category. Some camcorders feature a Backlight Compensation function (BLC) to combat the darkened effect. These are most times ineffective, however. Instead, try turning your subject more into the light to open up shadowed areas of the face. Lastly, light produced from a very low angle yields a ghoulish effect. Leave this for your next horror movie.</p><p>Chances are, professional lights will not be at your disposal for filming indoors. Not to worry though, you can make artificial lighting work for you by collecting what 'house-lights' are around and by increasing the wattage of their bulbs. Be sure to monitor the heat given off from extra wattage, you don't want to start a fire.</p><p>One way to effectively arrange these conventional lamps is in a group of three, as I've illustrated below.</p> <p>3-point arrangement</p><p>If you find the light delivered by this 3-point arrangement to be too harsh, add a reflector made from white, grey or black poster board. With this you can bounce a softer version into your scene. You can even experiment with cellophane gels, an umbrella, silver foil or other material to soften and color and redirect your lighting sources, in just about any way you want. Once again, be careful to monitor the heat level. You don't want anything going up in smoke. There are many other directions you can go with this equipment, too. Experiment with camera position and moving your lights forward and backward. Position a friend or place a stuffed animal amid it all to gain an idea of the effect. No matter how you do it, keep one very important Basic in mind - always compose before you shoot!</p><p>Zooming may be something you have played with in the past but for your professional looking film I recommend doing without this function. If your camera has a DIGITAL zoom function, turn it off, now. The greater the magnification of your image, the grainier (more digital noise) and more pixilated your video will become. A better alternative to using the camera zoom, when practical and appropriate, is to zoom with your feet or film from an ordinary office chair and have your friend push you - narrowing the distance between camera and subject. Lastly, not only can excessive zoom use make your film appear amateurish, it can leave your audience nauseous. I personally save zoom for the most dramatic visual moments of my production, as in capturing expressions and emotions during a particularly moving interview - or to reframe a shot during a pan when you can hide the zoom.</p><p>One film technique that I find fun and gives the sense of a real professional film set is to use a pan, crab, or dolly set up. Panning your camera is to pivot it horizontally - right or left - from a fixed point. Turning your head from left to right gives the idea. If your subject does require a pan, start with a 10- to 20-second recording and follow through with it smoothly, slowly and deliberately. Be VERY aware of where your pan starts, and where it will end. Nothing says 'amateur' more quickly than a pan that starts for no reason and ends up nowhere. A good sturdy tripod with a smooth fluid head is the thing that well executed pans are made of.</p><p>Crab and dolly set up is moving your camera laterally or forwards and backward On the professional level, this is done with a specially-built track-and-carriage apparatus. But for our purposes, an office chair, skateboard, or baby carriage will work just fine. Practice is the key here. And, of course, you will want to leave your camera's display window open to gauge your success and progress as you shoot. Reminder: using your display window uses up double the battery power.</p><p>TIP: If your intention is online video, avoid both pans and zooms altogether. Not only do they look bad on the Internet, any unnecessary movement slows down the video stream.</p><p>Take a look at this next clip, and download it onto your time line or watch it and imagine how you would sequence the footage. Notice also how the beginning right now is so hectic, would that be acceptable on youtube or as your introduction to a short clip?</p> <p>Moving along, lets discuss the last part of this lesson, and that is sound. As you have probably noticed while shooting and editing your sequences, Audio is essential for your films over all feel. And to ensure top audio quality, external microphones are the way to go. That's not to say that your on-board version hasn't value, but you'll definitely hear the difference when using a 'lavaliere' (lapel) or multi-directional microphone in its place during monologues and interviews. A further benefit of external mics is that they won't pick up your camera's motor noise.</p><p>In relation to camera audio settings, choose manual levels and the 16-bit, 48K settings on your camcorder. Displaying sound-levels in your viewfinder will allow you to gauge whether you have exceeded acceptable limits or entered the 'red-distortion' zone. Put sound-levels to the test before recording, by practicing in both loud and quiet environments, using both your external and on-board microphones. A mock interview with a friend or colleague will top-off your experiment, preparing you and your equipment for the real thing. For a real professional set atmosphere try attaching your external microphone to a pole and placing the combo in the hands of a friend to make a boom to record your scene (keep it out of the shot, though). Your sound-set will improve immensely!</p><p>In your edit you can also choose to have a music playing under your sound. As in the following clip notice though how with a little sound the intro footage of the cars kinda works....</p><p>Note: this last shot, sequencing and edit is to prepare you to realize what you can realistically accomplish (considering time and experience) to write your script, shoot it and edit it.</p><p>Part 2. Writing your script.</p><p>This is where the beginning lessons in shooting and editing your sequences comes in. Now you are familiar with what it takes to get good footage and how playing with your clips can alter your storyline. It's time to write your script. Here are some basic scripting instructions you can follow before doing so.</p><p>In all the sequences you have shot and edited you have applied the most widely used script technique used in professional films. This is the 3 Act Structure. Simply put, it is the beginning, middle, and end of a film.</p><p>Scripting prescribes the exact way in which the story is to unfold. This is where the result of brainstorming is outlined, gains focus, and acquires the richness and detail to make characters and location believable to your audience. It is a written description of your video story, spelling out who goes where, says what - when and how. It encompasses the setting, dialogue, background sound and all the visuals. Applied to the documentary form, the script contains questions, specifically formulated to prompt and lead 'actors' in their movements and responses.</p><p>Numerous guides to script-writing exist, many of which are excellent in their explanation of the craft. For our purposes, however, we'll take an abbreviated approach and work with a less complicated script 'outline'. With it, we'll sequence our stories and their characterization from beginning, through middle, to their concluding lines. However, your script outline should not be rigid. If something interesting comes up while shooting, go with your creative instincts. Nothing need be set in stone. But, to be safe, you may also shoot what you had originally scripted.</p><p>Before beginning any film project (especially if you are working with a crew or actors), it is essential to script and outline the storyline taking into consideration; location, characters and audience. The following clip highlights a unique element of Taiwanese culture - a day in the life of a betelnut girl in Taiwan. In this short clip you will be taken from beginning, middle and end of a simple sequence. The footage is very raw, and please feel free to download it, put it on your time line and edit, sequence. More practice, practice, practice. After this clip take a look at it with music to see how you can even make raw footage fun!</p><p>ACT 1: Beginning - This is the set up of your film. Here you want to grab the audience's attention and hold it. It is also the part that introduces the viewer to the location, and characters involved and a sense of what the purpose of your film is.</p><p>ACT 2: Middle - This is where you find the confrontation. Here is where your character meets his trials and tribulations. This clip segment is in preparation for its successor segment:</p><p>ACT 3: End - This is the resolution, or outcome of your character's trial and tribulation.</p><p>Shots list</p><p>While writing your script and to make your shooting plan more manageable I recommend you jot down on another piece of paper a shots list. This is basically a list of shots, times and locations and which characters you expect to be shooting in your scenes.</p><p>As you know from already practicing your editing, you need not shoot in sequence, rather shoot all the scenes needed for the location you are in, before moving on to the next.</p>",2
"Telling Your Story with Video","Shoot your Script - Assemble your Edit","Shoot your Script - Edit Your Take. Scheduling and shooting your movie. Editing - Sequencing your movie, applying titles, sound, music","<p>Part 1</p><p>For the purpose of this 4 week course I recommend that you follow your script as best as you can. IF you are convinced that another idea or shot will be better for your film then try it, tapes are not expensive so bring some extras with you, but I suggest you still shoot what you originally thought. During the edit you can choose.</p><p>That being said, do not be afraid to overshoot a scene or include scenes and shots on the spur of the moment.</p><p>Timeline your shooting schedule, make sure you know what you will shoot in a given day. Rescheduling can be difficult. Shoot from various angles. Plan on taking several takes of a scene to get the best quality, but keep in mind typically the first take is the best due to fatigue from your actors and crew. Hold each shot for a minimum of 10 seconds. This seems easy, but it's very, very hard, especially at first. Count it off in your head. You'll be glad you did when you start editing. </p><p>If your script takes more than 1 or 2 days to shoot, I suggest that when you get back home, go through your footage and write the time code eg. 00:10:09 -00:12:50 of your best shots, LOG it in a notebook and if you have energy and time, load those shots onto your editing software. This is will save you plenty of time when you get to your final edit. I did this while filming on location in Sri Lanka promotional video about the tsunami for an NGO Circle of Health International. I was able to show them a rough cut 'in the field' and get instant feedback so when I got back to my residence I knew exactly what they were looking for.</p><p>(Attention to the following clip one of the samples I originally showed to the NGO before leaving Sri Lanka) and this resulted in the editing taking much less time and everyone was satisfied with the end result.</p><p> </p><p>Now lets turn to something called Line of Vsion. Make sure you keep your subject in the camera frame, you need not follow them all the time, simply let your actors move in and out of the frame. Don't plan every shot at eye level. Use multi-angles, film a scene, then move the camera and film it again. Then chop them up in editing and mold them together.</p><p>Line of Vision example</p><p>Remember to shoot an opening and closing shot. These are your most important shots, since they place your viewers on the scene and set the tone for the story.</p><p>Remember your continuity! </p><ul><li>light and white balance needs to be the same in all the shots, or when you put two scenes together they will look different.</li><li>clothing your actors are wearing, </li><li>props be careful not to move them during break-time</li></ul><p>Interviews - mostly for documentary or if you meet a local during your travels and want to include them in your home movie)</p><ul><li>Choose a setting with good light and preferably where they feel comfortable. Ask them if they have any questions before you both get started </li><li>Leave a little headroom at the top of the frame.</li><li>Position your subject a little to the left or right of center and leave nose room or 'talking room' to the opposite side.</li><li>Don't count on your memory record it all. You never know when they will say something important.</li><li>Questions should be as neutral as possible. Avoid wording that might influence answers.</li><li>Questions should be asked one at a time.</li><li>Questions should be worded clearly. </li><li>Be careful asking 'why' questions. This type of question infers a cause-effect relationship that may not truly exist. These questions may also cause respondents to feel defensive, which may inhibit their responses to this and future questions.</li><li>Avoid asking questions where the response will be 'yes' or 'no.'</li><li>Encourage responses with occasional nods of the head, but try your best not to say yes yes or ah huh during their interview, or you will have a hard time to get the sound out during your film editing.</li></ul><p>Part 2 Editing</p><p>You have already edited simple sequences in LESSON 1 and 2, in this lesson you will learn to take your assembly cut and turn it into your rough cut. Video editing is best done in stages where you throw the footage together in an 'Assembly Cut,' add in extras for the 'Rough Cut,' Editing in this fashion will help the finished product have a consistent feel and save you from spending the first two hours editing the opening title slide, only to find out that the rest of movie really requires something different.</p><p>An assembly cut is the first stage whereby the video clips you have selected (log and capture) from your footage are done. Here is where you sequence your shots and find the flow that best tells your story. </p><p>The next step is the rough cut whereby each scene is trimmed down. After you have made your rough cut you may begin to add titles, transitions and work with your sound. Not everything has to be perfect in your rough cut but pretty close to finished.</p><p>Titles</p><p>Adding titles at the beginning of your film and credits at the end gives it a professional edge. If you are targeting your digital movie to the internet it is best to use fonts that are easily readable and about around 30-34 pt. You have options to put your titles on a black background or directly onto your footage. You may also choose to add effects to your titles, it is recommended to keep this minimal as it can come out looking rather amateurish. Play with them and find what best suits your subject.</p><p>Transitions</p><p>There are many transitions to choose from in all editing software programs. For the purpose of this course and due to the fact that each student may be using different software we will direct you on a few basic tips to give your film the professional look rather than go through each and every transition. Familiarize yourself with the various transition options you have and apply those that best suit your vision of your movie. Generally speaking to apply a transition you simply place it between each clip. That being said, choosing a transition is matter of personal choice, though you might want to consider a few basic tips: </p><p>When aiming for simplicity and grace, try not to use too many different transitions through out the video. Remember, transitions should never be the main attraction. Using too many transitions while shooting a documentary or presentation might make the video appear garish and tasteless.</p><p>The most widely used transition is the CROSS FADE</p><p>Sound/Audio</p><p>As you have noticed by working with your sample sequences the audio is added to the timeline with your video clip. By blending audio with your videos and you will see your videos reach new heights. Just how to make your movie flow using audio is a bit tricky and takes practice. You can fade out the sound or add an audio file containing your favorite song, background score or even narrate your video using microphone. </p><p>Types of Audio Effects you can create: </p><p>Mixing: You can choose to insert both the narration as well as background music to a video to be played simultaneously. To do so, you can place the background music on the second audio track. Now you can mix the narration and music together by using the volume graphs. You can lower the volume of the music whenever narration begins. While mixing 2 audio tracks, you can combine them in different ways to get various effects. </p><p>Audio Cross Fades: A cross fade makes a smooth transition between two audio files. This audio effect fades out one audio file and fades in another. It lowers the volume of one audio clip, eventually introducing the sound of 2nd file. This effect takes care that if you are trying to bring in a change of scene, you insert a new music piece without making it sound out of place or breaking the flow of your story.</p>",3
