Hi,

A new password has been requested for your account.

Go to the login page:
<%= login_url %>

Enter your email address and the following password:
<%= @user.temporary_password %>

This password will expire at <%= @user.temporary_password_expires_at.in_time_zone(@user.time_zone).to_s(:long) -%>.

If you didn't request a new password, simply login with your existing password.
