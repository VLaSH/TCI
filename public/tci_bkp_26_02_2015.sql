You\'ll find my submissions for assignment 1.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Part I<br />I\'m a very unassertive person by nature, so this assignment was quite challenging for me. Having said that, I should admit that I took this class to push myself beyond my limits and outside my comfort zone...and this assignment did just that. I took the documentary course directly before this and I found that I had to do it there as well...doing so though, did not make it any easier this time! I live in Tampa, FL...so not exactly the bustling metropolis of NYC or bigger European / US cities, but I figured i could find someone to photograph. I parked having an idea of where I wanted to go to make a photo. As I arrived I saw a waitress standing outside a restaurant taking a smoke break. Cliche shot? Certainly. But it was a photo I could take. With that in mind, I walked right by her, too afraid to ask if I could take her photo. I did this several more times. An elderly lady and younger companion sitting on a bench, a bookstore clerk working to pull some books out to the sidewalk. Finally, I made myself do it. There was a gentlemen sitting on a bench reading a newspaper. He was wearing red sunglasses, which I found added a bit of visual interest. I was on a time crunch and so I knew it was now or never, so I did it. I asked if I could take his photo for a photography class I was taking, he hesitated and then said, \"you gonna pay for it\"? Ugh, yes, I said...I can pay you a bit. So I nervously took photos, making awkward conversation and trying to remind myself to take a variety of pictures. When I decided I\'d bothered him enough, I handed him a five and thanked him for his time. When I reached a decent distance from him I flipped through the photos a bit disappointedly, seeing that I didn\'t have a great variety at all. The gentlemen\'s name, by the way, was Raymond. I looked up from my LCD screen and saw a man doing some kind of karate in the park, so I made myself approach him before I could talk myself out of it. I once again told him what I was doing and he happily obliged. He was a nice gentlemen, I don\'t remember his name, but he had a son named Joe who died of bone / marrow cancer 2.5 years ago. I felt immensely grateful to have met him and to have had that conversation. I would have never had that interaction had to not been for this class:) I was feeling much better now, still nervous, but not debilitatingly so. I passed the restaurant I initially walked past and saw a different waitress smoking. This time I asked if I could take her photo, and she kindly said yes. We chatted a bit, her name is Erika and she was new to the restaurant. As we were talking and engaging the other waitress (the one I passed the first time) came out and I took photos of her too. My final subject was a window washer. Honestly, though I found him interesting, I likely would not have engaged him had he not said something first (something about my smile...). Though I was a little uncomfortable I asked again if I could take a few photos. He was very happy to allow it, chatting happily for quite some time. At this point I was cutting it close on time and I knew I still needed to get the \"interesting billboard / background\" images. So, I parked myself in front of a glass mural thing by a children\'s museum and waited, and waited, and waited. My camera (Ricoh GR) died. Just as I pulled out my cell phone as a backup camera two family approached...and I snapped two quick photos. Not ideal, in the end, and basically the same photo with two different families, but I got it.</p>\r\n<p>Though the photos are nothing to look at, per se...I am proud of myself. Approaching complete strangers is a very difficult task for me and I was proud that I was able to overcome my nerves to get it done. I hope in time the nerves will ease and I can focus more on the actual art of photography :)-</p>',1,NULL,'2015-04-12 12:39:32','2015-04-14 14:49:17',115,NULL),(18,125,'Assignment 1',NULL,'<p>I do not find it that easy shooting with a 35mm lens.

I do feel that I am getting better thou. I guess in general I like the idea of sticking to one length as you start getting a feeling of what will be and what will not be in the frame at a certain distance and to include or exclude you just move quickly in or out. Sometimes wished I was carrying also a longer length but I can see how pictures with a wide length are so much more compelling.</p>',1,NULL,'2015-04-12 13:11:14','2015-04-12 13:41:42',145,NULL),(19,126,'Assignment #1 - Documentary projects for non-profits',NULL,'<p>I am a developmental worker. I come from the academic background of environment management and have been associated with a non-profit organisation as a researcher for almost 8 years now. A lot of information on social media and fund raising seems to focus on compelling images and photographic narrations of NGOs\' work. I decided to try my hand to be able to contribute to my organisation\'s story some day.</p>\r\n<p>Hence the selection of images. I had the weekend to play around once I joined the course. So the first photo is of one of our team rooms, vacant on an off Saturday. It\'s a stark contrast to the usual busy moments.</p>\r\n<p>The second photograph is of our display gallery, which showcases craft items and farm produce from the Himalayan villages that we work in. It also has a set of photographs depicting the range of work we carry out and the diverse cultural groups that we work with.</p>\r\n<p>The third photograph is from a training where one of my colleagues is showing youth from Himalayan villages, how to operate a mini weather station. These youth would act as advisors to the local farmers once their training is completed.</p>\r\n<p>The fourth photograph captures a vermi-composting demonstration site, where the farmers and young advisors are trained in the process of making organic manure.</p>\r\n<p>The fifth photograph captures one Senior Scientist explaining the vermi-composting process to the youth participants of the training. The demonstration visits help the farmers to understand the concepts easily.</p>\r\n<p>The sixth photograph captures the team of youth along with another of my colleague, visiting a large weather observatory and understanding the fundamentals of weather monitoring. Given the increasing climatic variability, these knowledge are essential for the farmers today, especially in fragile, remote Himalayan valleys.</p>\r\n<p>This is essentially the kind of work that I plan to capture through my photo essays.

So I tried &nbsp;to include as much as I could, in the best way possible, of those elements. Trying at the same time to transmit some feelings to the viewer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In addition I tried to pay attention to all small things that you mentioned in your previos comments. I may have missed some (I hope not).</p>\r\n<p>I have other images that I like, but I tried to select the best ones (I am not the best or most experienced picture editor :-) ). But I did\'t want to include too many images :-)&nbsp;</p>',1,NULL,'2015-05-20 15:41:22','2015-05-20 16:19:50',164,NULL),(32,170,'Assignment #2 - Outdoors/manual/ISO 400',NULL,'<p><strong>Created by Suzette Nguyen on May 19, 2015 03:49 - Marked as complete - 3 attachments</strong></p>\r\n<p>Hi David,</p>\r\n<p>I\'m submitting (3) pictures today - is that ok to submit other pictures later for the assignment?</p>\r\n<p>My friend and I made a trip to the San Diego Velodrome this last weekend to snap pictures.

I have created 4 public boards split into the 4 categories we agreed on and compiled shots that I felt I connected with and aspire to be able to capture soon.</p>\r\n<p>I have Also created 5 secret boards with my photographs split into the categories we agreed on, plus an additional \"breakfast\" category. I felt perhaps this needed its own category or subcategory under appetizers and mains (let me know what you think). The boards with my photos are marked as secret and I invited you to access these 5 boards (I used&nbsp;meeta@meetakwolff.com as the email address to reach you. Please confirm you got the invites and can access the boards).</p>\r\n<p>Regarding what I found out about my style from the general boards, please see below my analysis:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">I connect most with very \'styled\' story telling images which incorporate the ingredients and suitable props. <br /></span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">The theme of the dish, ingredient or drink is usually evident by the way the styling is done (for example summer dish, christmas dish, etc). The theme is also usually evident in the location in which the image is taken</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Side lighting is my prefered lighting (my eye is usually drawn to shots that are side lit more so than back lit)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">45 degree angle is my preferred angle and I relate to food shots taken from this angle (seemingly) more than other angles</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Close up shots (tight) are a preference it seems</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Dark backdrops, boards and props with a well lit subject seems to be recurrent in my selection</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Action shots are very appealing as well (drinks poured, sugar dusted, sauce drizzled, etc)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Harmonious colors are appealing to my eye more than contrasting or complimentary colors apparently</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I want to highlight that the way I went about this is by selecting all images without thinking about why I am drawn to them. Only after I felt I had sufficient inspiration shots in each category, I studied the images and drew the above conclusions about my taste. Very insightful excersise! Thank you :)</p>\r\n<p>Finally when it comes to my shots in the secret boards, I feel, to say the least, I have a loooong way to go :(</p>\r\n<p>Now onto my Positioning Statement, Please see below what I came up with after studying loads of my favorite bloggers/ photographers \"About Me\" pages. Please note that I related with concise, humble and up to a certain extent casual style (but not too casual that its almost conversational). Also, please note that this is incomplete as I didn\'t know how to end it! I havent had any hands on experience with clients so I couldn\'t say some thing like \"and this is where I am today, i have worked with X, Y and Z\" to end it... here goes:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">With a previous life in advertising, public relations and hospitality marketing, I have had over 10 years to develop an eye and a passion for compelling visuals that tell a story.

During that time I had the opportunity to work with a number of great photographers and visual artists in an &lsquo;art director&rsquo; capacity, and just about four years into that, I decided to take the plunge and pursue my passion for photography from behind the lens. I started off working as an assistant to an established food photographer, and additionally to one of the few food stylist in Dubai, with the aim of learning as much as possible on both fronts.</span></p>',1,NULL,'2015-05-22 06:22:25','2015-05-22 06:35:52',215,NULL);

Wide-angle lenses lay low on my priority list of equipment to buy. \"People-less\" landscapes weren&rsquo;t exactly my thing and I didn&rsquo;t shoot much in close-quarters back in those days either. It wasn&rsquo;t until years later that I purchased a 28mm prime to use for my first magazine assignment, just to feel \"professional,\" I guess.

Then, setting an adequate exposure (right combination of aperture and a slow shutter speed) each time, practice photographing your subject - hand-held - at 1/15 sec., 1/8 sec. and 1/4 sec. If you\'re still not satisfied with the picture sharpness you receive, try using the \"TIP\" outlined below. Once you are satisfied with your results, upload your best photograph made at each shutter speed setting (three photos) to the TCI website. And, please be sure to label each of these shots.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> Choose a subject - animate or inanimate - in good light and photograph it with a single focal-length lens (If you\'re using a zoom, place it on a specific focal-length setting and leave it there.). Move your viewfinder over the scene until you intuitively feel that the design/composition is right. (Note: One thing to keep in mind about wide-angle lenses is that there are no hard-and-fast \"rules\" regarding their use. The door is wide open to your creative instincts). Make a number of photographs in this way and then move closer to take the same picture again. Upload your best near-far combination of the same subject (compositional center-of-interest) - two photographs in all to the TCI site for critique. Please be sure to indicate at which aperture and shutter speed these photos were made.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Part 3:</strong> Select an inanimate object - building or object - as your subject. In good light, photograph this center of interest using an expansive depth-of-field (i.e. f8 or greater) and differing angles from the horizontal plane. Upload your favorite two shots from this take for critique. Again, please include the exposure data that accompanies this photo.</p>\r\n<p>So - in total you\'ll be uploading seven images to the TCI website for instructor critique. Best of luck with this first lesson assignment!</p>\r\n<p><br /><em><strong>TIP: For a solid grip on your camera, start by running your hand once or twice through the strap. That way, if you should slip, etc. you\'ll still have a firm grasp on your valuable piece of equipment. Secondly, while holding the camera securely in your right hand (if you\'re right-handed), place your left hand out in front of you, palm up. \"Plop\" the camera directly down on top of it and pull the viewfinder snug to your eye. Next, draw both of your elbows snug to your sides. Short of stretching out a tripod, this \"3-point\" stance (i.e. elbows firmly to the sides and viewfinder snug against your forehead) will help you to achieve steady exposures at almost any shutter speed and with a wide variety of lenses. Last touch is to place your feet at shoulder width - now you\'re set!<br /></strong></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',7,0,NULL,'2015-02-23 07:40:45','2015-02-23 08:05:44'),(25,127,'Establishing Strong Foregrounds','','<p>There are three parts to this week\'s assignment representing eight images in total to be uploaded to the TCI site for critique.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part 1:</strong> The key to compositional success in wide-angle photography, is the effective establishment of strong and immediate foreground interest. For this assignment, I want you to begin by doing just that. Practice placing both animate and inanimate subjects in this compositional space and upload your two best images with a person in the foreground and your two best featuring an object or animal in the immediate foreground of the frame - four photos in all.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part 2:</strong> If you have a focusing scale on the barrel of your lens, set it at 3 meters (approx. 10 feet) and leave it there. If you must, hold this position with a piece of cloth tape attached to the lens. If you have not such an adjustment on your lens (the majority of AF lenses these days don\'t), set the lens to \"manual\" and focus on something you know to be at this distance from the camera. Then, securing this adjustment set an aperture of between f8 to f16 (with a correspondingly appropriate shutter speed for adequate exposure). Now you\'re ready to just \"pull-up-and-shoot\" when photographing within this distance range. Practice this quick-fire shooting method with family, friends and objects and upload your two best images demonstrating your new-found proficiency with this technique. For best results, be sure to practice it out-of-doors in good daylight.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Part 3:</strong> As a final segment to this assignment, I would like you to combine what you have learned and practiced above with your own creativity.

Of course, you can do the exercises just for practice too.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Exercise 1:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Practice makes perfect! I want you to set your camera on Aperture Priority mode. Create a very simple set up, like the photograph of the pear or of the set-up with the milk bottle in the background, eggs or egg shells etc. in the foreground. Make sure your subject is placed on a table or countertop near a window so that you have enough light to light the set-up.</p>\r\n<p>Mount the camera on your tripod.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Set your aperture to the smallest value possible (this will vary depending on the lens you are using) and select the focus point in your frame. Take a few images with this aperture value.</li>\r\n<li>Without moving the set-up change your aperture value to a medium f/stop (f/5, f/6.3 etc.) and take a few shots.</li>\r\n<li>Finally, crank up your aperture as far as you can (f/18, f/22).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Note down the values your camera is giving for the exposure for each of the images you take.</p>\r\n<p>What I want to see in this exercise is <strong>3 examples</strong>, one from each category (1, 2 and 3). Share the details of each image: f/stop you chose, the exposure the camera used, the time of day and how much or little light you had for the particular image. Also share your thoughts on the difference you see in each image.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong></p>\r\n<p>Once again create a very simple set-up (if you are doing this on a different day). Still in Aperture Priority Mode follow the steps in Exercise 1 but here I want you to add an additional step between each category. After you have taken a shot with a small aperture in Aperture Priority Mode and noted what value your camera chose for the shutter speed, I want you to switch to Manual mode. Leave the aperture setting as it is and now you select the shutter speed value using the value from the previous shot as a basis.

Use daylight and get the best light you can on your subject and the environment.<br /> <br /> 1: Start with the pre-planned image.

Take the next image where you are working with a fairly wide lens and make sure that the environment around your subject tells as much of their story as their face and demeanour towards the camera.<br /> 3: Now use your patience and see if you can capture a moment you weren?t expecting to find, see if you can swerve off plan by following the mood and emotion of your subject on that particular day.<br /> 4: With simple lighting take a close up portrait of the sitter that brings out their personality without the aid of any other elements.<br /> 5: Take a look around the sitters environment and take a still life which you feel tells the most truth about this person.<br /> <br /> Enjoy this challenge, there is quite a lot here to get your head around but see if you can capture as much as possible.

Use your tests as guides for choosing your apertures, lenses, and equipment. Use your aperture priority for these shots to define how to best tell the story of the location.</p>\r\n<p>1. Find a location that gives off an emotion. It can be a busy lake, a quiet hillside, a peaceful grove of trees, or a misty beach. It could even be your own backyard. Photograph it using an aperture that presents the main subject of your story in the landscape to its fullest. Compose your shots both horizontally and vertically. Think about your ISO. If you have a scene you want to present very clearly, use a low number ISO. If you want to portray a soft, moody foggy scene, you could use a higher ISO to add some grain, enhancing the overall mood.</p>\r\n<p>2. Choose another location where you expect some sort of action to take place. It could be a path where bicycles are, a lake where animals visit, or a stream with fishermen. Photograph it when it is very still, and there is no sign of activity, then again when there is action. Patience is important here. Wait for the right moment to press the shutter button. Which image do you like better?</p>\r\n<p>3. Moving to another place, photograph it at different angles. Try putting your main subject in the center of your photo, then recompose it so that the subject is to the right of the frame and again towards the left. Tilt your camera up and take a shot, then down and take it again. Do you like more ground in the photo or more sky? Which tells your story best?</p>\r\n<p>4. Find a place that is not too far from home so you can visit several times. Photograph it at different times of the day. How does the mood change from morning throughout the day into evening? Remember to adjust your white balance and ISO if necessary. Use your polarizer when appropriate.</p>\r\n<p>Try your best to find things about the landscapes that are unusual. Things you have not seen before. Go back through your first assignments and use what you learned to make the best possible shots you can. Don\'t forget about your polarizer to cut down on glare and enhance colors. Take time to set up your tripod and check that the horizon line is straight.</p>\r\n<p>When you have completed your shots, upload two from each experiment for review and critique.

Keep the following things in mind as you shoot. Does the light create a mood? What story am I trying to tell? What aperture best describes the story? Is the sky interesting? If not, crop it out. Would your image look best in a horizontal or vertical format? Remember to use your polarizer when appropriate and do the same if you have a warming filter. Use your white balance setting to best enhance the overall feeling of the photo.</p>\r\n<p>1. Get up early. Go to a location to photograph it at sunrise. Try the following experiments. Shoot a few frames before the light appears on your subject to compare it to when the light hits. When the light casts its golden hue, shoot quickly, because it doesn\'t last long. You have about 20 minutes of optimum light. After that, you will still have good photos, but as the sun gets higher, it becomes more of a white light, and you need to add the glow in PhotoShop. Remember to adjust your ISO between before sunrise and after sunrise shots. The darker the light, the higher your ISO needs to be or your shutter speed may be too long to prevent noise.</p>\r\n<p>2. Visit a location in the middle of the day. Hopefully, you can find a spot with water to see the effect on the color. If not, shoot whatever you can to discover the contrasts that exist. Look for patterns and strong angles to add a graphic element to the image.</p>\r\n<p>3. Find a place that will look good in late afternoon. Somewhere with people or things that will cast long shadows. Sometimes a location with a combination of man made buildings and natural land works well. A beach with a pier, meadow with houses dotting hills behind it, rocky desert, or a roadside with tall trees. Your goal is to catch the soft light with interesting shadows, and textural elements of the objects.</p>\r\n<p>4. If you encounter overcast or foggy days, sing a happy tune. You can shoot almost anything. Wildflower meadows, streams, rivers, waterfalls, barns, and beaches all work well. Your skill at telling a story must be especially strong with these kind of shots.</p>\r\n<p>5. Go watch the sunset. You get to have a lovely experience while working at the same time. Compose your shot to involve most of the sky if there are interesting clouds. If not, make the land your story. Shoot your location as the sun is setting, and keep shooting well after it drops below the horizon. This is another time you will need to adjust your ISO. Just as with the sunrise shots, your exposure time can become too long for your camera to handle the noise that comes with it.</p>\r\n<p>I realize you may not have the opportunity to shoot all of these types of light within our time frame. Unfortunately, we cannot have weather made to order. If you don\'t get all of the weather conditions, choose different locations with the light you get and notice the differences between the locations.</p>\r\n<p>When you finish your shooting, upload two from each experiment for review and critique.

Here you will need to develop your artistic eye to objectively judge the quality of your shots. We tend to get caught up in the moment of image capture, remembering the sounds, sights and events we experienced while shooting. But that doesn\'t necessarily mean the shot is good. Look at photography books and magazines. Study the ingredients that make good images. Compare yours to theirs. Strive to achieve the best quality possible. Be objective about your photographs. Just because you took them does not automatically make them good. Professional photographers throw out many more images than they keep because their eyes have become trained to only accept the best. If you want to build a reputation as a good photographer, you can\'t put just any old image out there.</p>\r\n<p>Keep the following things in mind as you edit your photos.</p>\r\n<p>Are there any distracting elements that need to be cropped out? Is there too much dead space that should be cropped out?</p>\r\n<p>Is the exposure correct? Can the image benefit from bringing the exposure up or down?</p>\r\n<p>Is the image sharp? Would sharpening it help improve the overall look of the photo?</p>\r\n<p>Can the image use a lift from saturation?</p>\r\n<p>Using your best images from this course, choose 4 photos to enhance in your software program.

When you first start shooting it will feel a bit overwhelming to remember all of the 10 lessons as well as the rules of composition. But with enough practice these rules will become second nature, and then you can worry about the other elements of video (like lighting and audio). Here\'s what I want you do to by next week.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Spend 15-20 minutes shooting in-camera sequences. This means you should have a nice sequence without having to do any editing. Find an action and shoot wide (hold for 10 seconds then stop recording), move closer for a medium shot (hold for 10 seconds then stop recording), move even closer for a close up (hold for 10 seconds then stop recording) and move even closer for an extreme close up (hold for 10 seconds then stop recording). Do 3-4 of these, and each one get more creative in the order you do your shots and the angles with which you compose them.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Spend 20-30 minutes filming for your project that you storyboarded in Lesson #1. Use all of the rules of cinematography that we discussed as well as the rules of composition. Be mindful of sequences, but you\'ll be able to edit this film so you don\'t have to be as precise as in the previous exercise.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Write down your experience in both exercises to me (unless you already know how to upload videos to YouTube, then you could send links to some of the in-camera sequences). Was it more difficult than you expected? Easier than expected? What was the biggest surprise while filming? What was the biggest challenge?</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Watch \"<a href=\"http://mediastorm.com/training/beautiful-noise\">Beautiful Noise</a>,\" a compelling mini-documentary done by students at a MediaStorm workshop in New York City in 2008.

What we are now going to do is address the gaps that you are missing to get us started on the shooting. This will take a few weeks so do not be discouraged. In the end we might not use every single image you shoot over the next weeks but we will aim to select 20 of the best ones. </span><br /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I have tried to work out a schedule, which we can optimize together. If it&rsquo;s too ambitious let me know and we can scale it down a bit. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">After viewing your general boards vs. your boards is that many of your shots have a horizontal orientation whereas the images in your general boards are vertical. If you remember I mentioned this in the workshop that a vertical orientation is often a nicer way to go with food photography as it allows you to play around more with the DOF and build a deeper set. </span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So let us focus on vertical orientation for the images &ndash; but please do take some in the horizontal orientation too. </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Based on your categories I&rsquo;d like you to take at least 4 images per week. We will start simple with ingredients and for these I will give a few (easy) recipes for you to create cooked meals with. You are to shoot simple ingredient shots, food prep and then the cooked meal. Are you OK with this? </span><br />&nbsp;<br /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What I plan to do is go back to your general boards + use some of my boards and simply highlight an image I think you could be inspired by. In the comment field I will write your name @reef fakhoury so you get a message which image I mean. What you are to do is to study the image and interpret it by keeping your analysis of what you connect with in mind. Build / set-up your shot according your &ldquo;Connect list&rdquo; below:</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I connect most with very \'styled\' story telling images which incorporate the ingredients and suitable props.</span></span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The theme of the dish, ingredient or drink is usually evident by the way the styling is done (for example summer dish, christmas dish, etc). The theme is also usually evident in the location in which the image is taken</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Side lighting is my prefered lighting (my eye is usually drawn to shots that are side lit more so than back lit)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">45 degree angle is my preferred angle and I relate to food shots taken from this angle (seemingly) more than other angles</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Close-up shots (tight) are a preference it seems</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Dark backdrops, boards and props with a well lit subject seems to be recurrent in my selection</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Action shots are very appealing as well (drinks poured, sugar dusted, sauce drizzled, etc)</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Harmonious colors are appealing to my eye more than contrasting or complimentary colors apparently</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The list above is a great set of guidelines for you to consider every time you shoot. But do not get stuck up with, for example, side lighting &ndash; after you have taken your desired shot just move the set up around so you have back lighting and take a shot with this direction of light. Remember we want to show versatility. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I hope this makes sense. </span><br /><br /><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I have listed a few items and recipes (keeping it simple) but if you do not like the recipe or have another one you would like to try go ahead. In some I have listed an idea/suggestion which you might not have to cook yourself but maybe if you know a good restaurant etc. you can always get it from there (e.g. mezzeh). Please use this as a rough guideline and by all means be creative with other ingredients. By no way are you required to complete them all if you lack the time &ndash; on the other hand if you need more ;) then let me know. </span><br /><br /><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Categories: </span></strong></span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Food prep (raw, ingredients, spices, pre-cooked)</span></span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Spices</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Asparagus</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Herbs (Mint, Coriander, Flat leaf parsley &ndash;

Yeah you are right; sometimes it is difficult to work with one fixed lens. But sometimes it is also an advantage to use one lens because you really then know what you need to keep in the frame and what you need to take out of the frame.</p>\r\n<p>If you want, you can use any lens for your next assignments. It was a test so you can feel the advantages and disadvantages of using one fixed focal length.</p>\r\n<p>Nowadays I mostly use a 24-70mm f 2.8 lens and I can cover most of my interested areas. I take images of people, so I can use wide angle when I need more space/ context or I use 70 mm when I need to take portrait or detail shots.&nbsp; Actually I think a short zoom lens is better because it gives you more options.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let&rsquo;s talk about the images:</p>\r\n<p>01: It is always important to find something exceptional for portraits. For any portrait the face is the most important. The face should be an interesting one, otherwise it&rsquo;s very difficult to grab the attention of the viewer. Then use of good, evenly distributed light, a simple background that does not distract from he main subject, and the expression of the person is very a fundamental point for a good portrait.</p>\r\n<p>I really like your selection of the person. He&rsquo;s really got a very attractive and interesting face. The light looks flat in this photo and also it would be better if there were a little more space in this photo, so we can see a little better how he&rsquo;s dressed.</p>\r\n<p>I have edited the images a little and put some more light on his face. It is looking livelier now. The light was a little too dark.</p>',NULL,'2015-04-12 13:49:58','2015-04-12 13:49:58',NULL,NULL),(13,914,'Attachment',52,'<p>Hi Sejuti, This photo has nice composition.&nbsp; The diagonal \"line\" of the floor running through this frame adds \"dynamism\" and \"energy\" to the photo.&nbsp; These are characteristics of diagonal lines in the design of a photo.&nbsp; Such lines can be \"tangible,\" as this one is - or \"perceived,\" as in two people - one near the upper left corner of a composition and the other near the lower right corner of a photo - looking at each other.&nbsp; This latter example (although the diagonal line is only \"perceived\" or \"inferred\") stills brings the same \"feeling\" into the photo.</p>\r\n<p>Now to bring \"life\" to this photo and greater energy to the perception of your NGO \"Headquarters,\" you DO need people sitting at desks and worker and perhaps a person or two walking along that diagonal line of floor.&nbsp; Hand-holding your camera steady - or placing it on a tripod- and photographing with a slow shutter speed (for example: 1/15 or 1/8 sec.) you would capture those walking through in a semi-blur, which would bring dynamism and greater interest to your photo.&nbsp;</p>',NULL,'2015-04-14 11:35:18','2015-04-14 11:35:18',NULL,NULL),(14,915,'Attachment',52,'<p>Ideally, you would want to move closer to the display and into the space as I\'ve cropped it here.&nbsp; To bring such a photo to life, you would want someone actually looking at the images on display - or two people looking at and discussing what they see.&nbsp; Such shots can be \"set up\" using two of your colleagues.&nbsp; For the type of \"goal\" you have in creating a photo essay (i.e. to show the workings of your NGO), \"directing\" your compositions is completely valid.&nbsp; Your aim is not \"photojournalism,\" where setting up shots is unethical, but creating more of a \"corporate report\" for the agency you work for.</p>',NULL,'2015-04-14 11:36:19','2015-04-14 11:36:19',NULL,NULL),(15,916,'Attachment',52,'<p>Technically speaking, this photo needs a bit more exposure to open up the shadow areas.&nbsp; I would have suggested you take your exposure reading from the demonstrator\'s right hand and then lock-in this exposure for your shot.

I can see that my use of light is where I need to improve most. Having said that, when doing photos like this, particularly when approaching people (as opposed to finding a place with great light and waiting for someone to walk into it), would you ask them to move into better light? Or would you just wait for them to do so (it\'s all about the moment, after all).

I went through the same process too and great that you made your own scrim. So proud of you!!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SO: for the first three images in your exercises you did an awesome job. I love the light and it shows that you carefully and very thoroughly went through the process of finding the perfect way to light your images. The focus is on all of the images is really good. I like the way you took it a step at a time and compared how each image in your selection works on you. This is the best way to find your style.</p>\r\n<p>I find the soft focus on (34) Bowl as Main Focus 60mm appealing. The reds are vibrant and the white balance looks good. I&rsquo;d like to comment on a minor styling point &ndash; usually it is nicer not to crop off more than one side of a bowl. It&rsquo;s not a rule but rather something I find more appealing to the viewers eyes as it provides more balance and harmony and allows the eye to follow the outline of the plate into the image nicely. If two sides are cropped off the eyes have to pause on either side before continuing or trying to re-find a focus point. Does that make sense?</p>\r\n<p>I also really like (39) Bowl in an Environment - 60mm. It&rsquo;s probably my favorite &ndash; mainly because I am finding the elements work very well and the glass elements in the background allow diffused light to filter through beautifully. I love using glasses and bottle with water as an additional way to add diffused light and reflections to the image.</p>\r\n<p>I see what you mean with (53) Bowl in a Story - 35mm and I agree partly about it being too wide. But depending on the purpose this would make a lovely shot for maybe a cover of a magazine as it tells a story.</p>\r\n<p>Like you I also find (67) Bowl in an Environment - 50mm well executed too as with (39) it provides a nice balance and the viewer is right into the main hero. With both shots one can really play well with the depth of field / aperture to create a softer focus too.</p>\r\n<p>Great work on your first assignment. I am very pleased with the results Kara!

I was in London for my workshop and upon return got caught up in a big photo job! Sorry!</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for your submission of the first assignment. I see you only chose to do the exercises and not the assignment. After viewing your first images I think we will need a bit more practice. I understand you bought a new camera and are still getting acquainted with it.</p>\r\n<p>I see you are having issues with finding your focus properly that is mainly the reason why your images are not as sharp as they can be. Your set-up is fairly basic and I would like you to give this another try with slightly more elements. Try finding a nice background and place your fruit in a more voluptuous manner J Some in the back some in the front &ndash; maybe one or two cut up. The whole idea is to make the image appealing for the viewer. I know we are practicing the camera techniques here but as we move along I want you to consider these elements through each lesson. Please try taking all your images next to a window (as you will have read in the light lesson) as this offers the best most natural light for food images.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have created a smaller set-up then try your hand at the exercise again. Pinpoint where your focus is going to be and focus with the camera exactly there. A tripod is always helpful here. Now all you need to do is set your aperture to the same values you have here. I am sure you will be able to really see the difference.</p>\r\n<p>You said you got a 50mm lens and this is a prime lens with just one focal length only (in contrast to a zoom lens that covers a wider range of lengths). Prime lenses do not have the ability to zoom, so the photographer must move physically closer to or farther from their subject to achieve desired composition within the viewfinder\'s frame. Most lenses come equipped with a distance scale that allows the photographer to zone focus (judge appropriate focus based on estimated distance from the subject).</p>\r\n<p>  Focusing Through the Viewfinder:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Look through the camera\'s viewfinder window. Ensure that the lens is attached securely to the mount at the front of the camera.</li>\r\n<li>Point the camera toward your intended subject. Rotate the focus ring (located near the rear element of the lens, in front of the mounting threads) clockwise for far away subjects and counterclockwise for closer subjects. Fine tune your image by choosing a well-lit detail on which to focus. To start with try focusing on something closer to you / your lens.</li>\r\n<li>Adjust your aperture (size of lens diaphragm opening) to achieve the desired depth of field (DOF).   <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Remember:</span></strong> DOF refers to the range of effective focus in an image, or how much of the image can remain in focus at the aperture and shutter speed you have chosen. For example, if the foreground of an image is sharply focused and the background is blurred, it can be said to have a shallow DOF. If the foreground and background of an image are both sharply focused, it can be said to have a large DOF. Aperture ranges from f/1.7 to 5.6 will often provide shallow DOF, while f/8 to f/22 will provide larger DOF.</li>\r\n<li>If you are shooting in manual now set your shutter speed in relation to your aperture to achieve proper exposure.  <strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Remember:</span></strong> As a general rule, larger f-stops (f/2.8, for example) will require a faster shutter speed, as the diaphragm is almost wide open at this stop. Smaller f-stops (f/16) will require a slower shutter speed, as the diaphragm is nearly closed at this stop.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Here you will find a little bit more about Prime lenses:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/buying-guides/prime-lens-101\">http://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/photography/buying-guides/prime-lens-101</a></p>\r\n<p>Let me know if you have any further question or are having difficulties.</p>\r\n<p>Meeta xo</p>',NULL,'2015-05-13 12:54:25','2015-05-13 12:54:25',NULL,NULL),(118,31,'AssignmentSubmission',52,'<p>Very good return work done for this assignment.&nbsp; \"Image-type-wise,\" your strongest images are attachment 6 as a wide-angle scene-setting shot (although you\'ve marked it as a \"middle-distance\" photo, which it probably could be too); attachment 4 as a strong middle-distance photo and attachment 3 as a strong \"detail\" or \"close-up\" photograph.&nbsp;<br />Attachments 1 and 2 are also good, but haven\'t the strength of the shots listed above.&nbsp; Attachments 9 and 10 I\'d place in this \"less strong\" category, as well.</p>\r\n<p>Let me know of questions and / comments.</p>',NULL,'2015-05-20 21:15:19','2015-05-20 21:15:19',NULL,NULL),(119,1076,'Attachment',52,'<p>Good \"scene-setting\" type of shot.&nbsp; Exactly what I mean by \"context.\"&nbsp; My only suggestion here would have been to hang here for a while and try to capture the artist (spray can) in hand, gesture with it toward his creation.&nbsp; This would have better identified the painter as such and at the same time, have added a sense of \"moment\" to the photo.</p>',NULL,'2015-05-20 21:15:26','2015-05-20 21:15:26',NULL,NULL),(120,1077,'Attachment',52,'<p>I think you\'ve done well with this wide-angle image.&nbsp; You\'ve \"controlled\" the expansive perspective well.&nbsp; The second artist appears in the background, there\'s no clutter and artist and fish appear to be eye-to-eye in contact.&nbsp; Plus the walkway is a strong \"leading line\" into the photo.

The reason for this, is that your camera\'s light meter system read the large area of bright sky and attempted to bring its light down to \"middle gray.\"&nbsp; In doing this, the already darker landscape was reduced in exposure, as well.&nbsp; Understanding how a camera\'s light meter operates in this way to yield an image that is balanced for so-called \"18 percent\" or \"middle gray,\" the photographer will consider such a \"contrasty\" (extremes between highlights and shadows within the scene) and compensate by adding one or two stops exposure to this camera \"decision\" in Program mode.&nbsp; The way to do this, is to address your camera\'s \"exposure compensation\" adjustment.&nbsp; Depending on your camera modes, this can be a button or a dial.&nbsp; Go to it and add +1 for one shot and try the same scene, adjusting by +2.&nbsp; Via this process, you can make the most \"pleasing\" exposure from choices you are now offered.</p>\r\n<p>I post-processed this photo using Adobe Lightroom software to simulate just what adding a couple of stops (via \"exposure compensation\") to do for this auto-exposed photo.</p>',NULL,'2015-05-21 14:19:44','2015-05-21 14:19:44',NULL,NULL),(151,33,'AssignmentSubmission',52,'<p>Good job with this first assignment, Suzette.&nbsp; This basic camera / exposure information can represent a rather steep learning curve, but once it\'s fully understood, the door to creativity is wide open.&nbsp; You\'ll look at a subject or scene and consider just how you want to make of it photographically - choosing either shutter speed or aperture as your priority setting.&nbsp; Once you understand how exposure works, you\'ll be using aperture-priority, shutter-priority or manual mode most of the time.&nbsp; Fully automatic \"Program Mode\" will be there when you want to capture moments that are unfolding quickly - and the most important issue is to capture the scene as fast as possible with the best exposure decision the camera can, automatically, make for you in that instant.</p>\r\n<p>Let me know what questions you have surrounding any of my explanations, because all of these aspects of camera control for creativity are of \"foundation\" importance.

The very first steps to finding out where we can begin and what your voice is all about.</p>\r\n<p>Do not feel intimidated by the path you (we) need to take to get to where you want to be &hellip; it&rsquo;s a process and you will grow as we progress during this mentorship and also later. The important thing is to keep feeding those boards &ndash; the public ones but we will start filling up the secret ones and these will be the basis for your portfolio.</p>\r\n<p>With regards to your positing statement I want you to have another go.

From preparing the dish, using fresh ingredients to styling, propping, color, lighting and texture, I work with a dedication to each detail. My own personal passion is keeping the image as natural as possible, using natural light and food that has not been \"treated.&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n<p><em>Clients can expect diligence and commitment from me to meet their needs and accomplish their objectives.&nbsp;I prepare, style and photograph each subject to match my clients\' vision and have a resourceful and fully equipped studio and kitchen, which helps me to achieve your goals. I am available for cookbook, editorial, website, catalog, packaging or advertising assignments as well as writing food related articles and&nbsp;recipe development.</em></p>\r\n<p>A friend of mine has this: &ldquo;&hellip;. is a portrait photographer who specializes in real soulful imagery. Her photographs are authentic and raw and create a sense of intrigue to the viewer. She sees beauty in the everyday. Her images primarily utilize natural lighting, which showcase a sense of production and style. Odessa finds unnoticed moments that last. Her work can be seen in editorial magazines to commercial advertising.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>So for you - &nbsp;go back to the above list you created about what connects you with your style and create a few lines that you would like your client to know what makes you and your work special. Do not worry if you do not have experience etc. that is not the point of a position statement!

Vineet hope this course works better for you. ;) Over the next couple of weeks we\'ll be spending intensive time with each other and I hope to guide you through the challenges and difficulties you have been having with your food photography. &nbsp;I am really looking forward to it.&nbsp;  Please read through your lessons carefully ... do not be intimidated. If you have any questions along the way feel free to ask them in the discussion area. Being a small group I am quite excited that we can work one-on-one with each other. I would like to encourage that as a group you give feedback / ask questions on each other\'s photographs as well. This brings in different viewpoints and maybe allow us to view the images on different levels. &nbsp;  I am also very interested in knowing what camera, equipment, lens etc. you both are using - do you use a tripod etc.?

I don\'t edit the pics much in order to communicate \"what I saw is what I reflect\". That said, I do sometimes adjust some parameters using the basic tools that these devices have.  I have a Cannon Powershot G15 and can get a tripod. I reckon this should be a good start and I can possibly upgrade to something else as my understanding develops a bit more. I have seen so many of my friends pick up these awesome camera bodies and lenses only to then point and shoot in auto mode all the time.  The reason for this course is simple, I want to take better food pics as I am working to open a health food delivery business shortly. Since we won\'t have a dine-in space, social media (and the food pics) will be the primary mode of marketing. We will hire a pro initially to help us get off the ground but I love food too much to not dig into it :-)!  Hope this helps to explain the context somewhat. I am looking forward to working &nbsp;closely with you.    Best regards.    Vineet.  &nbsp;   </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>12 days ago - Vineet Chhatwal  </strong></p>\r\n<p>And of course...Hi Kara.  Its a pleasure to make your acquaintance here.   </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>12 days ago - Vineet Chhatwal  </strong></p>\r\n<p>Got some clue about Aperture and depth of field after messing around with my camera.

Looking forward to working with you over the next several weeks. In this course we are already working towards the first assignment with Vineet and Kara. As I mentioned in my first comment above&nbsp;I am very interested in knowing what camera, equipment, lens etc. you are using - do you use a tripod etc.? It will give me a better idea and also help me make suggestions if necessary.  Let me know if you have any questions or are \"stuck\" with anything.&nbsp;  Vineet: yes upgrading once you feel better about photography is always better. I have to say that over the past 2 years I am a big fan of mobile photography but mainly because I love Instgram. Having said that these devises can never replace a proper camera. I am very keen to see how you progress with your Canon Powershot - will you also be using the mobile devises for the assignments? Many aspects in my assignments actually focus on photography with a camera (primarily a DSLR but also Digital &amp; &nbsp;POS so you should be fine. Let me know if you have trouble with any of the assignments.&nbsp;  Kara: I think a you will find all the help and guidance in the lessons for your goal.&nbsp;  To all three of you YES to a tripod!! You\'ll find it helps on many levels. So Now I am looking forward to all your assignments.&nbsp;  Have fun! </p>\r\n<p><strong>3 days ago - Nicky Weber</strong></p>\r\n<p>  Hi Meeta, Kara and Vineet</p>\r\n<p>  I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this course and working with the three of you.&nbsp; I currently live in Australia although I am originally from South Africa (Meeta &ndash; I went to school with Jeanne!)  My dad has been into photography ever since I can remember and a few years ago recommended the Canon Mark II to me when I was ready to upgrade from my point and shoot camera.&nbsp; So I have this beautiful camera and the 70 &ndash; 300mm lens which I absolutely love.&nbsp; I bought a 50mm lens as most food photographers use it but haven&rsquo;t found it successful with food but rather people.&nbsp; I do own a tripod and even have a lighting kit (which I&rsquo;m yet to get into). I try to shoot manual but want to get a tether cable so that I can ensure that I have focussed properly.  The reason for doing this course is that I am working on my own little recipe book of Italian food &ndash; it is a personal project rather than something that I will sell one day.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t found my own style yet and instead of coming up with my own food layout I go through my two files of magazine photographs that I like for inspiration.&nbsp; I am hoping that the assignments will push me a bit to be more creative and find my own voice.&nbsp; I used to shoot a lot of top down shots but have been trying to do more vertical shots.&nbsp;   I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed your website and photos Meeta and was so delighted to find that you had an online course.&nbsp;   I&rsquo;m away from Friday for the weekend and with the lack of light before and after work will only be able to complete the first two assignments by 18/19 April.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be reading through the lessons whilst travelling to Jindabyne.  Have a great weekend everyone and look forward to seeing your posts Kara and Vineet!   </p>\r\n<p>Nicky</p>',NULL,'2015-04-12 12:08:54','2015-04-12 12:08:54'),(46,52,309,'<p>Hello Sejuti, </p>\r\n<p>Welcome to the course!&nbsp; Two questions I have for you:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>&nbsp;What (generally speaking) is your background in photography?</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;What type of subject / topic are you interested to work on for your photo essay?</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Looking forward to working with you on this.<br />David</p>',NULL,'2015-04-13 14:13:12','2015-04-13 14:13:12'),(47,104,308,'<p>Dir Sir,</p>\r\n<p>Thank you for offering this opportunity to learn through online interaction.

Let me answer your questions in two parts. One about me and one about ideas. It will be easier to do it this way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Quick background about me: I was born in Italy where I studied Physics. I love to learn about people so I studied Psychology and Higher Education at a University in UK to understand how people think and especially learn. I studied especially issues like problems of women in education, of disabled people and so on.</p>\r\n<p>I travelled extensively from Alaska to Nepal (where I have many dear friends) to Malaysia to see other cultures and understand other people. I climbed extensively around the world and I am an active Fireman (Volunteer) close to Z&uuml;rich (where I live). In addition, since I have many interests, four years ago I created an international mountain race (www.sardona-ultratrail.com) to help a valley in Switzerland to get more tourists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Swiss mountain people are wonderful once you know them well...</p>\r\n<p>I have always felt a very strong need to do something about the problems in the world, to help people. I have always needed (and the need is even stronger now) to understand (in some way) suffering and tragedies. To understand violence, love, sadness, happiness, honour and so on. I feel that people, their history, and especially their feelings are what makes the world interesting and varied. I need to touch other cultures and ideologies to remind me that the world is not what I see everyday in Switzerland. There are many people who are less lucky than us, and I think is our duty to do something about it. We are the privileged ones. Even informing ourself and understanding what is going on is a first important step in the right direction. I learned that text is important and fundamental but images can really change the mind of people, they impress and leave a deeper mark than words. This is why I turned recently to Photojournalism and documentary photography. It would be an honour to be able to leave a mark with an image (or more) that I took. To know that, thanks to my work, the life of someone (even only one person) is now better. I believe that no change is too small.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I have come to understand that telling a story about people is a way of participating in their experiences. If you understand them, if you are a part of their life (although for a short period of time), in a certain way you feel what they are experiencing, you are living it. It is indeed a marvellous possibility to greater understanding.</p>\r\n<p>I strongly believe that photojournalism in general can really make the people see what (often) they don\'t want to see. So it is a fundamental way to change the world. Is a way to help people. Is a way to let the world see what is really happening (like Journalism). But I don&rsquo;t think I have to tell you this. You know it way better than me.</p>\r\n<p>And this is why I signed for this course. I want to learn as much as I can about how to do it. What are the best methods, what is working and what is not. And, apart from shooting a lot, I think that suggestions from someone who is doing it, is probably the best way of learning.</p>\r\n<p>I hope it clarifies what I think and why I decided to take this course.</p>\r\n<p>Umberto</p>\r\n<p>PS I will post a second answer regarding ideas for projects.

I have an idea on a social theme, but I have the feeling is a bit too complex (for various aspects) for this course. I will outline three ideas that, in my opinion, are concrete enough for such a course.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My main idea is to investigate and document the trafficking of women in Switzerland, and the work of FIZ (check&nbsp;http://fiz-info.ch/en/Home). My idea would be to follow one or two women that has had this terrible experience with the help of the FIZ center. I think they are doing a wonderful work. I am afraid that this is a complex subject and requires some time to do it properly (possibly more than 6-7 weeks we have at our disposal). I feel is a bit too much for this course, altough it would be an incredible interesting and important long term project. It may need quite some time to find women willing to participate and collaborate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My other two ideas would have a less social impact, but possibly more doable (I believe they are still interesting from a documentary point of view).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Culture in the kitchen: I would like to see how kitchen in different restaurants are organized and how people work with food (in Swiss restaurants, Thai, Chinese, Italian, etc.). I would like to be able to let the viewers see the differences and how cultural and geographic origin will play a role in the relationship between chefs and food. So the idea would be to spend time in the kitchens of restaurants and try to immortalize in images life moments: stress of many orders, pauses, etc.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Life behind the scene in a zoo: I would follow the workers of the zoo (volunteers and paid staff) and try to immortalize what kind of work they are doing. What love it goes into such a job, what difficulties.<br />If I consider the four points you highlighted in your text I think the first two ideas fit more nicely, although I believe the first project is more a long term one that is difficult to fit in 6-7 weeks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I had also another idea but I believe it cannot be done in 6-7 weeks. I would like to follow a family with a disabled child (a theme that is very important to me) and show how difficult (or beautiful) life can be. But to find a family willing to collaborate is not so easy. This also may be a long term project that requires a high sensitivity, lot of preparation time, and possibly a bit more experience.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here I would like to know your feedback. You have quite a lot of experience. What do you think?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance, Umberto</p>',NULL,'2015-05-07 07:57:47','2015-05-07 07:57:47'),(62,106,158,'<p>1 day ago - Umberto Michelucci</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hi David,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>after some additional brainstorming I came up with other two ideas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Life in a shopping mall: I think that it would be very interesting to document the different sides of life that you find in a big shopping mall. One can try to understand the questions of who/why/where/how of different people going there for different reasons. When is full of people, when is empty. Early in the morning when still empty, on weekends when is full. Parking places exceedingly full, long lines in shops, etc. Is an aspect of moder life that is becoming very frequent. Small shops are dying and big shopping mall are prospering (at least here in Switzerland). &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I think it is a very interesting theme.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What we waste: It is rather interesting how, especilally in Switzerland, people are wasting an incredible amount of food and different items. Things are thrown away when still new, since people have enough money to buy new ones. Food is wasted, clothes are wasted, electronic equipment are wasted. There is no end. So much could be achieved with all things that are wasted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>It would of great importance to draw attention on what we waste, and how much we could do if we could pay more attention.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>What do you think? I will stop with ideas now. I think they are enough ;-)</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks again for your time, Umberto</p>',NULL,'2015-05-07 08:00:29','2015-05-07 08:00:29'),(63,52,158,'<p>about 16 hours ago - David Bathgate</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hi Umberto,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Here are my thoughts on the story ideas you\'ve posted:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>1)&nbsp; Trafficking of Women -</strong> Although working with / through an organization such as FIZ is a good \"in\" to such a story, I too think this would be more of a long-term project.&nbsp; It would require gaining the trust of a number of \"actors\" who could feel participation would bring them and family members into danger, should their visual stories be told. In short, definite social impact and storyline importance, but difficult to gain necessary access in such a short amout of time.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) Culture in the Kitchen -</strong> This could be an interesting story if approached in a novel and dynamic way.&nbsp; Let me say here though, that I mentored a photo student in a Moroccan kitchen during a worshop I led not long ago and the result wasn\'t all that exciting.&nbsp; If going this route, you might do better focusing on a particular ethnic restaurant catering to a Swiss clientele - covering everything from the purchase of ingredients, to preparation and finally serving in the dining area - the whole \"scene\" and the \"antics\" that may follow.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3) Running a Zoo -</strong> I actually think this might be your best story choice.&nbsp; Most everyone is interested in animals and how well (or not) their occupants are cared for.&nbsp; You could offer the zoo director photos in exchange for spending time throughout days capturing \"behind the scenes\" images of the daily routine of zoo and animal care - everything from feeding to cleaning living areas to how the zoo vet treats ailing animals.&nbsp; I think such a story could result in very dynamic photography.&nbsp; Zoos are controversial, so I think such a story would have strong social value, as well.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>4) Family with Disabled Child -</strong> This story has been done quite a bit already.&nbsp; And although still interesting to a broad audience, the photographer needs to spend a lot of time around the family and in the home, something that can be \"annoying\" if an accepting family is not found.&nbsp; Even if one knows such a family personally, it will turn out to be a long-term project, whereby you are capturing images several at a time in the course of a number of family visits and accompaniments.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5) Shopping Mall Life -</strong> This one would require a number of permissions from everyone in charge of the mall to patrons and customers you photograph close enough in to yield impactful photos, versus those captured from a distance with a long lens. Due to recent events involving terrorist acts and shopping malls in various locations around the world, there exists a great deal of \"suspicion\" surrounding people taking photos in such widely-visited venues.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>6) What the Swiss Throw Away -</strong> This could be a good story.&nbsp; Switzerland is seen as a wealthy society and an environmentally conscientious society. A broad audience would have interest in a story well done that shows just what the Swiss consider \"garbage.\"&nbsp; You would need to connect with and accompany waste collection units and follow them to where that waste is dumped and disposed of.&nbsp; Another contact would be Swiss companies that recycle and capture their operations.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So in my opinion, the zoo story and the Swiss waste story would fit best the paramenters outlined in this first lesson. Plus I think a good story could be had from either situation in the time allotted for its completion.&nbsp; First step would be \"selling\" your project to \"key players\" in these arenas.&nbsp; Permissions and acceptance to be there are something photojournalists and documentary photographers spend the majority of their time on.&nbsp; Actually taking photos is a small slice of that \"pie.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I hope my commentary here helps.&nbsp; Feel free to discuss any of these points / issues further I you like before making your final story choice.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,<br />David</p>',NULL,'2015-05-07 08:04:11','2015-05-07 08:04:11'),(64,107,367,'<p>I have done with europe tour</p>',NULL,'2015-05-07 11:13:47','2015-05-07 11:13:47'),(65,107,361,'<p>good</p>',NULL,'2015-05-07 11:21:55','2015-05-07 11:21:55'),(66,106,158,'<h3>about 4 hours ago - Umberto Michelucci</h3>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hi David, thanks for your feedback.

The recycling area are going to invite me to discuss the project, but it will probably be in roughly 2 weeks (in Switzerland next week is only 3 days long, holiday...). One of the zoo told me they are not interested (or probably they don\'t want unwanted Photos), but I am still asking what is possible. I asked the second zoo and I am waiting for an answer.  </p>\r\n<p>So I think that also the waste is going to work, but it will take some time.</p>\r\n<p>  I thought that to avoid to waste too much course time I should find something that I can learn from, while waiting for the possibility of shooting the projects we discussed.  </p>\r\n<p>I learned that a Graffiti artist was going to paint a construction site in Z&uuml;rich and so I decided to go there and try to shoot the work, how is done, to document the process. I was there two times and I will be back next week. I am thinking of possibly asking the artist if I could follow him in his studio or in other places where he is working and document his work. I stopped and brought him coffee and talked with him, to learn what he does, how is working, etc. Is an interesing guy. The city paid him to pain the otherwise dull construction site walls on a bridge (roughly 200 m of wall).</p>\r\n<p>  It does not have a direct social impact but is something I can work on immediately. I have already some images that I could post and get your feedback. And the work is interesting to document. But I could use some help in deciding what kind of images one could shoot.</p>\r\n<p>  As soon as a possibility open for the other two projects I will start with them. I think is also ok if I don\'t really finish one of them (I guess they will go on for a bit longer than June to be able to capture the many aspects that will make it a good story, difficult to decide when a project is finished right?), but I am still decided to get as much as I can from this course.</p>\r\n<p>  I will continue to brainstorm and see if I can come up with ideas that could work in a short time frame and that would give me quickly access.  </p>\r\n<p>What do you think about the artist idea?  </p>\r\n<p>Cheers, Umberto </p>',NULL,'2015-05-11 18:18:23','2015-05-11 18:18:23'),(77,52,158,'<p>Hi Umberto,  </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The scenarios sounds very familiar to me and my work.&nbsp; These are the kinds of situations and \"waiting games\" that all documentary photographers and photojournalists deal with on a regular basis.&nbsp; Frustrating to say the least.&nbsp; Thing to do, as you have discussed here, is to find something solid and interesting for the interim.&nbsp; And I think your street artist idea and situation is just that.&nbsp; Check out this <strong><a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/videos/international/2014/12/11/spc-ones-to-watch-street-artists-a.cnn\">video link at CNN International</a></strong>.&nbsp; I\'d advise to go with this and do it in the most dynamic way you can.&nbsp; It can be a very visual and \"edgy\" kind of story that may just speak of \"social impact and meaning.\"  </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Best of luck!  </p>\r\n<p>David</p>',NULL,'2015-05-11 18:23:25','2015-05-11 18:23:25'),(78,106,158,'<p>Hi David,</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>thanks for your comment.

Hope you are well and ready to dive into the world of food photography and styling with me.&nbsp; Over the next couple of weeks we\'ll be spending intensive time with each other and I hope to guide you through the challenges and difficulties you have been having with your food photography. &nbsp;I am really looking forward to it as for now we are one-on-one in this session.</p>\r\n<p>  Please read through your lessons carefully ... do not be intimidated. If you have any questions along the way feel free to ask them in the discussion area.</p>\r\n<p>  I am also very interested in knowing what camera, equipment, lens etc. you both are using - do you use a tripod etc.? It will give me a better idea and also help me make suggestions if necessary.   </p>\r\n<p>When you complete your assignments and exercises please do give me as much detail about the image as you can. The technical details (f stops, ISO etc.) but also where the light was coming from, your workflow and process and any challenges you faced would help me get a better insight on the images you submit and your thought process.  </p>\r\n<p>So to answer your questions 1) A slow shutter speed in terms of food photography would be used in way a) when it\'s quite dark and we need to let more light into the camera or b) when we want to create a sense of motion for example wine being poured, while keeping everything else in focus.  </p>\r\n<p>Above the image of the pear would be the best example - I used a tripod and as it was shot at 5 PM in the winter I hardly had much light so as you can see the shutter was extremely slow at 1 sec, which I could not have taken without a tripod.</p>\r\n<p>  2) One cannot really have a \"preferred\" white balance setting as it depends on the situation / light you are in. If you are shooting in natural light it can change within a second (a few clouds move in front of the sun) - if you are shooting in artificial - controlled light you can use a set WB. So you need to view the current lighting situation and use that.  </p>\r\n<p>Having said that when I am shooting for myself / blog or when I am travelling I usually leave my WB to auto BUT only because I know my camera (Canon Mark III) handles WB extremely well when on auto and I do not have to change much in post-processing. However, when I am shooting for clients I custom my white balance (using a white or grey card) to my light situation always.   </p>\r\n<p>Enjoy yourself with lesson one and remember there are no dumb questions ... ask me whatever you are unsure of.   </p>\r\n<p>Warmly,  Meeta </p>',NULL,'2015-05-21 16:06:24','2015-05-21 16:06:24'),(96,114,249,'<p><strong>3 days ago - ashlee bixby</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>  Thank you Meeta! &nbsp;I am very excited to be here with you!!!  </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>To answer your question, I am using a Mark III (Canon) with a variety of lenses. &nbsp;I am brand new to food photography, but have been taking pictures of in manual mode for a couple of years. &nbsp;I mostly use a 24-70mm zoom, but I have access to a wide variety of primes as well (ranging from 14mm to 300mm). &nbsp;I have a tripod and pull it out occassionally, but not often.&nbsp; I had asked if you use yours often because I may want to get a table top sized tripod for this class if we will be using one frequently.  </p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I also have a flash and a couple of strobes with softboxes that I play with, but am just starting out with those. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>  I wanted to also ask you what lens (or lenses) &amp;/or focal lengths you use the most for your food photography?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>  Thank you so much, I am so excited to get started!&nbsp;</p>',NULL,'2015-05-21 16:10:49','2015-05-21 16:10:49'),(97,70,249,'<p><strong>2 days ago - Meeta Khurana-Wolff  </strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Hi there Ashlee!

photographers - including the masters, you would see a abundance of mediocre shots, some toss-out-immediately pics and hopefully, one - possibly two - really strong photographs. Take another look at your own work and most likely you\'ll encounter a similar distribution - also with a couple of real \"keepers.\"&nbsp; So what makes the difference? What places the very strongest images - the most compelling photographs, shoulders above the rest?</p>\r\n<p>First thing to keep firmly in mind, is that there is no magic attached to becoming a good photographer.&nbsp; Most anyone can learn to use a camera and there are no \"Moments of Divine Revelation\" involved in any of it.&nbsp; Toddling over one\'s father\'s camera at the delicate age of six months and clicking a perfectly composed snap of the family dog, says nothing about who will be the next photographic great.&nbsp; Making compelling photographs comes from developing a sound foundation of camera skills and acquiring the knowledge of what works within the photographic frame and what does not.&nbsp; Beyond this lies the development of one\'s own vision - a personal and creative way of seeing and interpreting the world.&nbsp; This can only come from practice, experience and the supportive guidance of a knowledgeable mentor who has successfully traveled the photographic path, before you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>So here\'s what you need to know to start your journey:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A photograph consists of two basic elements - foreground and background.&nbsp; </strong>\"Elementary,\" you say.&nbsp; Well listen, they don\'t just have to be there, they must work together, as well.&nbsp; What lies within the frame - what you see through your viewfinder - must add to a visual \"whole.\"&nbsp; Background must support in some way (can even be psychological) the subject of your composition and vise versa.&nbsp; If some element - even if it\'s on the very edge of your frame - doesn\'t fulfill its role in this respect, you need to find a way to get it out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Get close and fill the frame.</strong>&nbsp; Those first-time snap-shots that placed uncle Jeff as a small element in the middle of a vast frame just don\'t cut it when it comes down to judging compelling photography.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the photograph below, shot at a brick factory in Nepal, I stood atop the mass of just-fired bricks to capture the action of workers involved in clearing the kiln.&nbsp; My subject is the man piling bricks atop his head, dust filtering into the air, signs of struggle on his face.&nbsp; The background?&nbsp; It\'s just what this image is about - nothing more, nothing less - <em>bricks and human toil</em>.&nbsp; Subject and background are composed to support one another.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Great Light:</strong> You probably already know that early morning sun and that late in the day make for the most aesthetic and powerful images.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I worked early in the morning for the shot above - 7 a.m. I think it was in the Kathmandu Valley.&nbsp; The air was clear and crisp.&nbsp; I remember the morning very well - the light, the sounds - the smells of smoke still filtering from the dying kiln fires.&nbsp; Oh! And two other important characteristics of this photo and all strong images include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Great Color:</strong> If you\'re working in color, limit the number and hues you\'re working with.&nbsp; \"Few\" and \"related\" are the keywords here.&nbsp; Keep the color contents of your image simple.&nbsp; No more than four closely-related colors make for the strongest photographs.&nbsp; If black and white is your choice, strive for a full range of tones, from pure white to stark black and as many grays as you can manage, in between.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Interesting Composition:</strong> Move uncle Jeff away from the center of frame unless he\'s sitting cross-legged and meditating.&nbsp; Center-frame brings \"tranquility\" and a static feel to your photo.&nbsp; For a touch of dynamism, place Jeff closer to one of the four corners of your viewfinder.&nbsp; \"Rule-of-Thirds\" is the guideline to follow, in most cases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I went the \"Rule-of-Thirds\" route in my brick factory photo, placing the subject (worker with bricks on head) near the lower left corner of the frame, with co-workers and \"work-to-be-done\" surrounding him, throughout the entire frame.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sense of Moment:</strong>&nbsp; <em>Icing on the photographic cake</em> - capturing an action, nuance - something happening \"beyond the ordinary\" in your photograph, this is what \"<em>Moment</em>\" is about.&nbsp; You want to stir emotion in your viewers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I\'ve got two examples of capturing the <em>Moment</em> for you, below - one subtle, the second more dramatic.&nbsp; Both fill the bill of adding something \"noticeably other\" to the composition.&nbsp; The first photo below comes from Montalcino (Tuscany), Italy.&nbsp; It was made during lunch hours when streets of this sleepy hill-top village were all but empty - except for a lone figure of a Capuchin monk, making his way up a cobble-stone street.&nbsp; I stopped, set my camera\'s exposure, knew I wanted the old door on the left of the frame to \"balance\" the approaching figure, which I would position on the right side of my photo.&nbsp; When the monk approached a position that felt intuitively \"right,\" I made my photo.&nbsp; Ok, so what about the \"sense of moment\" bit?&nbsp; Subtle it may be, but that up-turned foot protruding from the monk\'s robes - propelling him forward up the long incline of a ancient, narrow street, is the element that brings dynamic to this picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The next example is more \"in your face.\"&nbsp; This image was made recently during a political rally in Istanbul, Turkey.&nbsp; Long lens from the sidelines?&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; I moved in front of the gathered crowd of onlookers with a wide-angle lens to frame this young social crusader and capture \"the moment\" of youthful energy this man expressed.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>',14,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-12-11 08:50:57','2015-03-26 13:43:32'),(94,18,'lesson-study',NULL,'<p>lesson-study</p>',5,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-12-12 08:09:19','2014-12-12 08:09:19'),(95,32,'Mid dec lession',NULL,'',6,1,'Sunset.jpg','image/jpeg',71189,'2014-12-24 08:23:52',NULL,'2014-12-24 08:23:54','2014-12-24 08:23:54'),(96,33,'mountain',NULL,'<p>mountain</p>',5,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-12-30 07:47:24','2014-12-30 07:47:24'),(97,33,'second-mountain',NULL,'<p>second-mountain</p>',5,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2014-12-30 07:50:16','2014-12-30 07:50:16'),(98,34,'Using Shorter Lenses',NULL,'<p><strong><em>While lenses 50mm and longer are traditional choices for people shots, there\'s expressive power at the other end of the focal-length spectrum, as well.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Many of the first people photographs I ever took were made with a 50mm lens. From there, I moved in the telephoto direction like many a beginning photographer does. Those earliest stages of my work dealt with family and friends and shined with the signature-soft backgrounds characteristic of a 70-200 zoom, set to a wide aperture. Wide-angle lenses lay low on my priority list of equipment to buy. \"People-less\" landscapes weren&rsquo;t exactly my thing and I didn&rsquo;t shoot much in close-quarters back in those days either. It wasn&rsquo;t until years later that I purchased a 28mm prime to use for my first magazine assignment, just to feel \"professional,\" I guess. But at that point the tide had turned and \"wides\" had moved to a prominent position in my camera bag &ndash; especially when it came to photographing people in new and novel ways.</p>\r\n<p>To begin with, wide-angles are very \"social\" lenses. They move the photographer to come closer to people and to interact with them on a level that&rsquo;s just not possible with lenses of any other focal-length. And for me, it&rsquo;s that moving into \"personal space\" with a wide and relatively non-intrusive lens that can mark the difference between just a shot of a person and a feel for the personality behind the picture. Take the portrait presented below, for instance. I came across this man a few years ago in northern Afghanistan, near the historic site of Bamiyan, where a giant stone sculpture of Buddha once stood. What first struck me about this man was the air of \"dignity\" he radiated and the lines and folds of cloth that cloaked and guarded his face from the country&rsquo;s harsh sun. I shot from a few meters away at first and then moved nearer. The man didn&rsquo;t refuse and even connected with me on a somewhat personal level for those short moments; until I was able to frame the elements I wanted with my 35mm lens - my nearly \"standard\" lens at the time - squeeze the shutter and tell the story. I thanked the man, he smiled and we both went away content with the interaction.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>But there are even greater advantages accruing to lenses shorter than the one I used here. Expansive perspective and tremendous depth of field are among the characteristics increasingly available to photographers using lenses 28mm and beyond &ndash; traits at hand to create stunning people shots, along with the things they do.</p>\r\n<p>One direction to go with this, no matter which wide-angle lens you choose, is to fill the frame entirely with your subject. I did just this in following photo example.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Awaiting a brilliant sunset, I walked a beach in the south of India several years ago. Looking over my shoulder, I noticed a group of young Muslim school girls with ice cream cones, following in my footsteps. When I stopped, they stopped &ndash; and giggled, so I decided to take photographic advantage of the situation and walked toward them. When we met, the girls immediately jockeyed for position before my lens. I played along, positioning my viewfinder&rsquo;s frame for the best composition. Reaching what I wanted, I closed the shutter. The \"energy\" that filled the frame at that moment was immense and wide-angle coverage gave it just the \"immediacy\" it required.</p>\r\n<p>A second approach to photographing people with a wide-angle lens is to choose your backgrounds well. All photographs consist of a \"subject\" and a \"background.\" Simple enough, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be just any old background if your picture is to cross the threshold separating \"snapshot\" from \"Photograph.\" That is, every element within your composition should, in one logical way or another, fit with every other element in the frame. Together, these elements should then support, in a logical manner, the main subject of the picture. If a background element doesn&rsquo;t do this, the photographer should move camera position to remove it. And if that&rsquo;s not possible, a wider aperture should be set to render the background \"unrecognizable,\" by one stop of light or more.</p>\r\n<p>But a wide-angle frame need not be restricted to a single subject and held to a single \"plane.\" Use the extensive dimensional qualities of wide-angle lenses to explore your human subject more fully, add context and \"environment\" to your expression and a \"psychological\" aspect to your subject&rsquo;s interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>Beginning with next photograph below, I&rsquo;ve tried to do just this. Here, I&rsquo;ve created an \"environmental portrait\" of this Turkish girl in the context of her Islamic school in Cologne, Germany. Using a wide-angle zoom set to 24mm and opened to f-stop 2.8, I made several photographs of this classroom scene from a few meters away. Receiving an affirmative nod from the teacher readying her lesson at the front of the room, I moved quietly closer to this young student seated in the first row. The girl&rsquo;s shyness kept her eyes on the Koran in front of her. I then lowered my perspective and stabilized my elbows on the table in front of her, composed my image to include classmates throughout the background and squeezed the shutter the moment she looked my way. It was the glance I was hoping for and the soft and thematically-fitting background I&rsquo;d planned. [Note: the closer you are to your sharply-focused-upon subject, the shallower the depth of field behind that subject will be. This holds true for lenses of any focal length, but is of particular interest for those seeking soft backgrounds while using wide-angles and their characteristically great DOF.]</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>The next picture highlights yet another facet of people photography for which wide-angle lenses are uniquely suited &ndash; the juxtaposition of elements within the frame to express a particular emotion or feeling. This image was made in northern India. Walking through village streets one morning, I spotted this shopkeeper and movie advertisement on a wall, next door. The faces seemed similar, the eyes dark and haunting. I asked the man if he minded standing next to the poster for a photo and he agreed. But it took a wide-angle lens &ndash; in this case a 28mm &ndash; to bring him and the section of poster-board I wanted together, expressing the air of lurking psychological suspense I intended.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>But juxtapositions and relationships set up in wide-angle, people shots need not always be so \"literal.\" The photographer can often identify and incorporate elements of design that affect the look and feel of the message being sent. My next image is a case in point. Here I positioned a model near a window to fix a \"match\" between this simple, but graphic background and the woman positioned before it. Let me explain.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Two sets of elements work together - and in counterpoint - to make this photograph effective. The first consists of the soft, sensuous folds and curves of hair and sweater that define the model. The second is brought by the hard diagonal lines drawn in shadow on the wall behind her. (Note: diagonal lines, whether visible or imagined, add visual tension and energy to compositions.) It is the like-direction tilt of the model&rsquo;s head that unifies the two &ndash; subject and background, adding visual interest to the frame. Develop an eye for design elements such as these and you&rsquo;ll bring greater strength to your wide-angle compositions with people, every time.</p>\r\n<p>Any discussion of wide-angle lenses and people photography must touch on the subject of \"distortion.\" Shoot head-on with a 35mm to 24mm lens and you&rsquo;ll see virtually no hint of it. Choose wider lenses or approach your subject from more acute angles and it will be noticeable in your pictures. Key to the phenomenon is to remain flexible, for creative advantages lie within. For instance, to make this last photo below, I sat on the front steps of a Buddhist monastery in Sikkim and pointed my 24mm lens upward to photograph this monk standing at the front doors. The effect is one of \"accentuation.\" The young man appears to \"tower\" in his devout role within Sikkimese society.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Other instances exist too (e.g. the hands of a golfer on his club; the eye of a billiard player looking down the length of his cue stick, etc.) where e a bit &ndash; if not a lot &ndash; of distortion can further the photographer&rsquo;s interpretation of a person or group, raising people pictures from a wide-angle perspective, to a completely different level. Experiment and see!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-01-12 09:06:14','2015-02-26 10:08:42'),(99,34,'Approaching Strangers',NULL,'<h6>Getting the photos you want from the people you don\'t yet know.</h6>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m basically shy and introverted as far as personality types go. It was always a major anxiety issue whenever I had to get up and give a talk in school or &ndash; in adult life &ndash; to give a presentation to a room full of strangers. It&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve always struggled with and in some ways have finally conquered. But as with even some of the most seasoned professionals who regularly include people shots in their work, for me approaching strangers to take their picture is nearly every time a re-rallying of confidence kind of affair.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s perhaps, therefore, fortunate that a percentage of the photographs I capture as a professional are made &ldquo;by the side&rdquo; of someone I&rsquo;m working with. In some cases this is a writer who&rsquo;s drawing the attention of the subject. He or she directs the questioning and personal interaction and I&rsquo;m standing slightly out of the way and waiting for just the right expression, hand gesture &ndash; any sort of &ldquo;peak&rdquo; moment in the subject&rsquo;s body language to squeeze the shutter and further my picture story.</p>\r\n<p>In other cases, I&rsquo;m embedded with military personal in conflict zones where I&rsquo;m even more of an observer. Given certain stipulations, I&rsquo;m &ldquo;sanctioned&rdquo; to be there to photograph whatever incidents, action and situations occur. I follow soldiers as they do house searches, question villagers and hand out humanitarian aid. Again, all I have to worry about is &ldquo;getting the picture.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;win anyone over,&rdquo; gain their confidence, establish rapport or engage them in any kind of conversation to get my shot. Excluding whatever risks lie around me, it&rsquo;s relatively unencumbered and easy stuff -&ndash; carte blanche to make the photos I want without having to really &ldquo;deal&rdquo; with the interpersonal \"management\" that lies between.</p>\r\n<p>Are these the kinds of people shots I would always like to make? No question, when a photographer knows his or her craft &ndash; can work fast and competently with the camera, some pretty stunning images can come from it. But these are out-of-the-ordinary situations. A photographer has rarely someone along to do all the &ldquo;people work&rdquo; that will bring these kinds of visual responses from the subject. If we want power and impact from the people images we make, we have to encourage it, learn and practice how to do it and go out and &ldquo;earn&rdquo; such shots for ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly all of the photographs I make have people in them. Those images that don&rsquo;t will have some tell-tale sign or impact of human presence in them somewhere, though. I&rsquo;ve always said that a good 95 percent of my work has more to do with &ldquo;social skills&rdquo; than it does with camera craft and I still hold to this. An ability to interact and get along with others - at all social and economic levels, as well as cross-culturally - is the greatest asset a people photographer can have.</p>\r\n<p>Can I offer tips and methods for approaching strangers with a camera that will not only land you a quick shot and you&rsquo;re out of there, but bring power and emotion to the photos you make? I can - and do it in a progressive way that stretches your comfort zone for getting in there and photographing people you do not yet know.</p>\r\n<p>We\'ll start with images like the first one below.&nbsp; This photo was made during a Catholic &ldquo;Youth Day&rdquo; rally held in the city of Cologne, Germany. The situation was one of joy, energy and celebration. Amid the &ldquo;brotherly&rdquo; feeling throughout the crowd, it was easy to get close and capture the types of people pictures that define such events best. Using a 24mm wide-angle lens brought me into contact with my enthusiastic subjects, making the connection between subject and photographer even more personal, emotional and &ldquo;intimate.\" Be on the look out for public festivals, fairs and events where people congregate. Then mingle among the festivities to capture exciting, close-in people photos in a relatively comfortable people-photography environment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>A next step is to go &ldquo;one-on-one&rdquo; with your subject - but doing it in a way that the comfort zone you\'re presently in, is not over trodden. With the next two examples, I&rsquo;ll explain just what I mean.</p>\r\n<p>In contrast to the first example, the following second photograph raises the bar just a little in terms of challenge. Here the situation is not one where the photographer can simply &ldquo;party along&rdquo; to get the shot. The situation is one of daily life; the photographer is not involved, just an outside \"observer\" of the scene. My presence in this case is not marked by engagement with the subject. And although eye contact may exist, there\'s no personal \"relationship\" between subject and camera to say just \"who\" this subject or these people are.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Photographed at riverside in the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, I wanted to capture the color and sheer numbers of people making this ferry crossing, throughout the day. However I chose a time of the day that suited my mission best - late afternoon when people were more relaxed in stride and the quality of light was at or near optimum. Then seeing this particular boat on approach, I positioned myself for its landing. Using a 28mm lens, I set my exposure using f11 to capture the great depth of field I wanted, pre-focused on a point on the ground several meters in front of me and waited for disembarkation of the group. When this beautifully dressed woman reached my pre-focus point, I clicked the shutter. The passengers walked around me and I was again on my way. Look for such places where interesting people shots lurk, observe and anticipate the action and then pre-set your camera and ready yourself for shots just like these.</p>\r\n<p>Exploring the streets of the Lebanese town of Moukhtara, a community dominated by the Druze cultural-religious group, I came across this friendly figure.&nbsp; The Lebanese guide accompanying me immediately struck up a conversation and I \"joined in\" with smiles and nods of my head at seemly appropriate moments.&nbsp; My camera was in plain view and eventually I nonchalantly took a shot here and there using a 28mm lens.&nbsp; Due to the fact that I was standing on a low wall above the subject, my camera angle placed me slightly higher than he, but I felt the novelty of this perspective added to the light nature of this man\'s demeanor.&nbsp; And although the background was simple and uncluttered, I used an aperture setting of f5 to soften it a little and bring greater definition to my subject.&nbsp; Compositionally, I placed my him \"rule-of-thirds\" near the bottom left corner of my viewfinder frame, allowing the man space to the right, to \"interact\" with.&nbsp; I also \"framed\" him within the borders of the doorway behind him, instead of completely ignoring this architectural feature and allowing the figure of the subject to overlap these strong background lines.&nbsp; Finding a \"moment\" to capture wasn\'t hard here.&nbsp; The man was so animated that all I had to do was squeeze the shutter button.&nbsp; He offered plently of them.&nbsp; As always, I focused sharply on the subject\'s closest eye to the camera to ensure that his entire face would appear in sharp focus to the viewer.<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>For this next photo example, I ventured &ldquo;inside&rdquo; to capture this photograph set in an Istanbul hair salon. How did I make it? I just walked inside, spotted this interesting looking stylist, held up my camera, smiled and the two smiled back in agreement. Shooting here with a 24mm lens, I set my camera&rsquo;s ISO to 200 and f5.6 to retain as much background clarity as the lighting situation in the shop would allow.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The next two pictures were made in India. Both are environmental portraits and both involved establishment of rapport with the subject, before the picture was made. In the case of the first, I frequented this chai (tea) shop on numerous occasions before the owner-operator came to recognize and &ldquo;know&rdquo; me in any real way. Except for my minimal grasp of her language &ndash; Hindi &ndash; we communicated only through gestures when I ordered tea without sugar. She would always see me with a camera, but it wasn&rsquo;t until later visits that I set out to use it at all. When I did, there came no objection and I was granted (without words) freedom to photograph anything (including her) from any part of the tiny shop I wanted.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>For making the final photograph, I spent a couple hours talking with this man via his rudimentary English. Passing by his front door one morning, he greeted me with questions: Where did I come from, where was my family and what was I doing in a place like this? Once I satisfied his curiosity with detailed answers, I was invited for tea. The experience brought a fascinating interaction and powerful pictures besides. In this photo, my host &ndash; then in his mid-fifties &ndash; was telling of his life in this small, rural village. In the process, he took a picture from the wall behind him and proudly displayed \"the storyteller as a young man.\" I got down to a low camera position in order to shoot upwards and accentuate his figure against the spartan surroundings of his simple room. This is the resulting shot.</p>\r\n<p>Many a powerful people photograph begins when eye contact is made and rapport is built. Friendliness, respect and a competent camera style is the path to take when looking for that fleeting grin, raise of an eyebrow or rubbing of an eye that tells the camera - and the viewer - a whole lot more about what it is to be human. Begin your journey where you most feel comfortable, then strive to stretch your vision through true interaction with your subject. In the final product, it\'s all well worth it.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-01-12 09:07:14','2015-02-26 10:06:12'),(100,34,'Making the Best of Light and Perspective',NULL,'<h6>While lenses 50mm and longer are traditional choices for people shots, there\'s expressive power at the other end of the focal-length spectrum, too.</h6>\r\n<p>Many of the first people photographs I ever took were made with a 50mm lens.

My next image is a case in point. Here I positioned a model near a window to fix a \"match\" between this simple, but graphic background and the woman positioned before it. Let me explain.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Two sets of elements work together - and in counterpoint - to make this photograph effective. The first consists of the soft, sensuous folds and curves of hair and sweater that define the model. The second is brought by the hard diagonal lines drawn in shadow on the wall behind her. (Note: diagonal lines, whether visible or imagined, add visual tension and energy to compositions.) It is the like-direction tilt of the model&rsquo;s head that unifies the two &ndash; subject and background, adding visual interest to the frame. Develop an eye for design elements such as these and you&rsquo;ll bring greater strength to your wide-angle compositions with people, every time.</p>\r\n<p>Any discussion of wide-angle lenses and people photography must touch on the subject of \"distortion.\" Shoot head-on with a 35mm to 24mm lens and you&rsquo;ll see virtually no hint of it. Choose wider lenses or approach your subject from more acute angles and it will be noticeable in your pictures. Key to the phenomenon is to remain flexible, for creative advantages lie within. For instance, to make this last photo below, I sat on the front steps of a Buddhist monastery in Sikkim and pointed my 24mm lens upward to photograph this monk standing at the front doors. The effect is one of \"accentuation.\" The young man appears to \"tower\" in his devout role within Sikkimese society.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Other instances exist too (e.g. the hands of a golfer on his club; the eye of a billiard player looking down the length of his cue stick, etc.) where e a bit &ndash; if not a lot &ndash; of distortion can further the photographer&rsquo;s interpretation of a person or group, raising people pictures from a wide-angle perspective, to a completely different level. Experiment and see!</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-01-12 09:08:21','2015-02-26 10:10:44'),(101,34,'Seeing Photos Within Photos',NULL,'<h6>Not seeing the forest for the trees can be a photographer\'s nightmare, too.</h6>\r\n<p>Every photographer has walked onto a scene overrun with people. The bigger the crowd and the more hustle-and-bustle there is - the more daunting a task it seems to get any kind of meaningful photographs from it all. There are several ways to approach such a situation. The first is to simply wander through the crowd, capturing images as they cross your path.</p>\r\n<p>In the first example below, I did just this one day while walking through a busy plaza in Nepal\'s over-crowed capital city of Kathmandu. Following the flow of pedestrian traffic one morning, I turned to catch this rickshaw driver standing high on his the pedals, in search of potential customers. Warm, early-morning sunlight was just beginning to wash into this part of the ancient city, resulting in a rich and pleasing mix of highlights and shadows. The young businessman\'s face was so positioned, that the spot-lit effect on it drew my attention and I stopped to build a composition in my viewfinder. I quickly looked around to see what else I might include in my wide-angle (i.e. 24mm) view that would \"play-off\" this main subject in an interesting way. High on a building in the background, I noticed a billboard with three faces, lit with the same nice light. The faces on the billboard struck a similar note to that of the rickshaw driver and the diagonal \"line\" that could be drawn between the two - lower left and upper right - brought visual tension and energy to the frame. I made the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>The second way to capture meaningful images among crowds, is to find an inconspicuous spot where things seem to be happening and make your stand, capturing interesting faces and situations as they come to you. This was the approach I took in making the next photograph.&nbsp; Captured during a Tibetan Buddhist temple ceremony in Dharamsala, India, I positioned myself discretely near the front of a line where the devout were paying homage to a statue of Buddha. As each attendee approached, I evaluated his or her \"photo potential.\" One of my favorites, this capture of a mother guiding her child through the experience, derives from simply choosing an opportune camera position and waiting for just the right time - a private and intimate moment, in this case - to come along.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>A third strategy is much more proactive in its design, calling on the photographer to make a plan of just how he or she going to approach all that seeming chaos, dive in and come away with some powerful images of people to be found there. With usually not a lot of time to get the job done, this is my primary method and I\'ve rarely been disappointed with the results. Here\'s how I go about it.</p>\r\n<p>Such plans of action should ideally begin with a degree of preliminary research. Find out all you can about the event, scene or situation before you arrive. Gain a general idea of just what will take place, in which locations and why. This overview information will give you the best idea of how the situation will be laid out, where best to enter it from, where the best light for photographing people will be, etc. If it\'s a regularly-scheduled market or bazaar that you\'re interested in, go there without your camera a few times, if you can - take a look around, buy something from one of the local vendors and ask questions that only an insider like they could give you an answer to. Strike up those rapport-building conversations and use the contacts each time you return to further your photographic project.</p>\r\n<p>For preparation like this I had little time a couple of years ago when photographing in Lebanon. I was there for the so-called, \"Cedar Revolution,\" which drew massive numbers of demonstrators and supporters to the streets. With excitement and political fervor high, people photographs were everywhere. The question was only, where to begin to capture even a fraction of what this phenomenon was all about? I started from the top and worked my way downwards - literally, bringing focus to my people images by moving from the general to specific details within the crowds.</p>\r\n<p>I went into this situation with only one contact, a Lebanese colleague and friend who helped get where I wanted to go. The \"research\" I took with me stemmed from a summary internet brief of the situation - not as much information as I would have liked to have had, but it was a start, nevertheless.</p>\r\n<p>Taken from the roof of a multi-storied building, the following photo captures one demonstration situation which occurred just south of the Lebanese capital, Beirut. I wasn\'t along up there either. Many photographers had climbed the long stairway before me, positioning themselves near the unsecured edge of the roof to get shots like these. My friend held tight to the back of my jacket as I made my way also to the brink. I moved to just behind where a crowd supporter was waving the Lebanese flag. I made my photo with a wide-angle (again 24mm) to capture the hordes below and squeezed the shutter just as the flag swung - just so - into my viewfinder. Then, I stepped back with care and made my way to the stairs and back to the street.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Reaching the ground, my colleague and I began photographing at the edge of the crowd. Here we found a contingent of college students from the American University in Beirut, who had stationed themselves for support of the event. The colors, of course, were brilliant and banners, placards and enthusiasm charged the situation with a captivating energy. I began to photograph, choosing the demonstrator placed as subject in the left of the frame of the photo example below. As with many such public events where participants are thoroughly engaged with the moment, making photographs - even close-in captures with wide-angle lenses - are fairly easy. People want to be noticed and to show others their support of the cause. It\'s a good opportunity to just go for it, and this is what I did here.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>After making this initial photograph, I took a few steps closer with the same lens to isolate / showcase this particularly enthusiastic participant, still further (photo below). I held him in the viewfinder and each time I saw a \"sense-of-moment\" expression or gesture about to happen, I readied my finger on the shutter button. Luckily too, the light cooperated for this series of people-specific shots. With the luck of a passing cloud bank that remained for a good ten minutes, I was able to work with the best of people-light - soft, even and with a degree of richness to, as well.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The next phto below took my quest for isolated people details still further. Seeing another group of students coming my way, I scanned the crowd for anything \"telling.\" This time it was a Lebanese flag painted on the cheek of this young marcher. I walked beside the group for a short distance and when a spot opened up for me to move in, I did to capture this person and her national emblem before falling away.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>And there\'s yet another way to capture situations that seem beyond the reach of planning or even isolating images of particular individuals and the details they hold. This is to go the route of the creative. I went this direction to capture the next photograph shown below.&nbsp; Made during a candlelight march by Buddhist monks in India, I simply set my camera to aperture priority and selected a slow shutter speed of 1/15 sec. to expose this scene in natural, late afternoon light. As the procession passed, I squeezed the shutter as the monks streamed by. As for thinking \"composition,\" I looked over the group carefully upon approach to see just what was coming. I then made my decision as to who I wanted in the picture and where and then waited for it all to materialize in my viewfinder. This strategy and this capture, interpret well the mood and energy present at just that moment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Note of caution - When you are photographing in large and / or tight crowd situations, maintain awareness of who is around you at all times. You don\'t want to fall prey to pickpockets and you don\'t want to be injured by crowd momentum, either. I always take a moment here and there during my shooting to glance around, if only to let others see that I am conscious of what\'s going on to the sides and behind me. Having a friend along is a real asset, too. Then they can do the watching, leaving you free to concentrate - without worry - on the photos you want to make. If they\'re photographers, as well, the two of you can then switch roles and give the other a chance with the scene. Point is - just stay safe!</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-01-12 09:09:07','2015-02-26 10:13:06'),(102,35,'Test Lessaon 1',NULL,'<p><strong><em>While lenses 50mm and longer are traditional choices for people shots, there\'s expressive power at the other end of the focal-length spectrum, as well.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>Many of the first people photographs I ever took were made with a 50mm lens. From there, I moved in the telephoto direction like many a beginning photographer does. Those earliest stages of my work dealt with family and friends and shined with the signature-soft backgrounds characteristic of a 70-200 zoom, set to a wide aperture. Wide-angle lenses lay low on my priority list of equipment to buy. \"People-less\" landscapes weren&rsquo;t exactly my thing and I didn&rsquo;t shoot much in close-quarters back in those days either. It wasn&rsquo;t until years later that I purchased a 28mm prime to use for my first magazine assignment, just to feel \"professional,\" I guess. But at that point the tide had turned and \"wides\" had moved to a prominent position in my camera bag &ndash; especially when it came to photographing people in new and novel ways.</p>\r\nTo begin with, wide-angles are very \"social\" lenses. They move the photographer to come closer to people and to interact with them on a level that&rsquo;s just not possible with lenses of any other focal-length. And for me, it&rsquo;s that moving into \"personal space\" with a wide and relatively non-intrusive lens that can mark the difference between just a shot of a person and a feel for the personality behind the picture. Take the portrait presented below, for instance. I came across this man a few years ago in northern Afghanistan, near the historic site of Bamiyan, where a giant stone sculpture of Buddha once stood. What first struck me about this man was the air of \"dignity\" he radiated and the lines and folds of cloth that cloaked and guarded his face from the country&rsquo;s harsh sun. I shot from a few meters away at first and then moved nearer. The man didn&rsquo;t refuse and even connected with me on a somewhat personal level for those short moments; until I was able to frame the elements I wanted with my 35mm lens - my nearly \"standard\" lens at the time - squeeze the shutter and tell the story. I thanked the man, he smiled and we both went away content with the interaction.<br /><br /><br />\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>But there are even greater advantages accruing to lenses shorter than the one I used here. Expansive perspective and tremendous depth of field are among the characteristics increasingly available to photographers using lenses 28mm and beyond &ndash; traits at hand to create stunning people shots, along with the things they do.</p>\r\n<p>One direction to go with this, no matter which wide-angle lens you choose, is to fill the frame entirely with your subject. I did just this in following photo example.<br /><br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Awaiting a brilliant sunset, I walked a beach in the south of India several years ago. Looking over my shoulder, I noticed a group of young Muslim school girls with ice cream cones, following in my footsteps. When I stopped, they stopped &ndash; and giggled, so I decided to take photographic advantage of the situation and walked toward them. When we met, the girls immediately jockeyed for position before my lens. I played along, positioning my viewfinder&rsquo;s frame for the best composition. Reaching what I wanted, I closed the shutter. The \"energy\" that filled the frame at that moment was immense and wide-angle coverage gave it just the \"immediacy\" it required.</p>\r\n<p>A second approach to photographing people with a wide-angle lens is to choose your backgrounds well. All photographs consist of a \"subject\" and a \"background.\" Simple enough, but it shouldn&rsquo;t be just any old background if your picture is to cross the threshold separating \"snapshot\" from \"Photograph.\" That is, every element within your composition should, in one logical way or another, fit with every other element in the frame. Together, these elements should then support, in a logical manner, the main subject of the picture. If a background element doesn&rsquo;t do this, the photographer should move camera position to remove it. And if that&rsquo;s not possible, a wider aperture should be set to render the background \"unrecognizable,\" by one stop of light or more.</p>\r\n<p>But a wide-angle frame need not be restricted to a single subject and held to a single \"plane.\" Use the extensive dimensional qualities of wide-angle lenses to explore your human subject more fully, add context and \"environment\" to your expression and a \"psychological\" aspect to your subject&rsquo;s interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>Beginning with next photograph below, I&rsquo;ve tried to do just this. Here, I&rsquo;ve created an \"environmental portrait\" of this Turkish girl in the context of her Islamic school in Cologne, Germany. Using a wide-angle zoom set to 24mm and opened to f-stop 2.8, I made several photographs of this classroom scene from a few meters away. Receiving an affirmative nod from the teacher readying her lesson at the front of the room, I moved quietly closer to this young student seated in the first row. The girl&rsquo;s shyness kept her eyes on the Koran in front of her. I then lowered my perspective and stabilized my elbows on the table in front of her, composed my image to include classmates throughout the background and squeezed the shutter the moment she looked my way. It was the glance I was hoping for and the soft and thematically-fitting background I&rsquo;d planned. [Note: the closer you are to your sharply-focused-upon subject, the shallower the depth of field behind that subject will be. This holds true for lenses of any focal length, but is of particular interest for those seeking soft backgrounds while using wide-angles and their characteristically great DOF.]</p>',5,2,'grid-image-6.jpg','image/jpeg',51351,'2015-02-05 06:37:18',NULL,'2015-01-22 09:34:50','2015-02-05 06:44:09'),(103,36,'Sample Lesson to Test complete flow',NULL,'',30,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-01-23 08:12:34','2015-01-23 08:12:34'),(104,39,'Historical places of india',NULL,'<span style=\"color: #666666; font-family: HelveticaNeue, \'Helvetica Neue\', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18.5px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><strong>Varanasi Ghat</strong> :<br /><br /></span> Ghats in Varanasi are the most holiest places of the city situated along with the banks of </span><a style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-family: HelveticaNeue, \'Helvetica Neue\', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-stretch: inherit; line-height: 18.5px; vertical-align: baseline; color: #ef7f2c; text-decoration: none; outline: 0px; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\" title=\"The 7 Most Sacred Rivers of India\" href=\"http://www.walkthroughindia.com/attraction/the-7-most-sacred-rivers-of-india/\">holy river Ganges</a><span style=\"color: #666666; font-family: HelveticaNeue, \'Helvetica Neue\', Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 18.5px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: #ffffff;\">.

The mere word conjures up exciting images in our minds. As traveling photographers, we want to bring back pictures that will visually express our impression of a place. You might be planning to create a book of your journey, or a visual presentation that you can show on your computer or TV. Or, maybe you just want to make images that have the impact you felt when you experienced the place. Whatever the reason, you want to make engaging pictures that express a sense of place.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to good composition, light, proper exposure, etc., travel photographs also need to contain information that tells the viewer about the place. What was the scenery like? What do the people look like, or dress like? What are their daily activities? What are the details that capture the very &lsquo;fabric&rsquo; of a culture? Imagine the challenge if you tried to do that in just one photograph! Thankfully, we get to make many pictures of a place when we travel, and these, combined, can create a wonderful narrative of our travels.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>If you approach your photography with the idea of telling a story, and the pictures you make will be the result of your thinking creatively, anticipation skills, and being a keen observer of your surroundings. It&rsquo;s a bit like writing, wherein you answer the &lsquo;who, what, when and where&rsquo; questions to tell your story. In photographs, we can do the same sort of thing. So, keep those in mind as we go forward through the lessons.</p>\r\n<p>There are several different &lsquo;types&rsquo; of pictures that, when combined into an essay, tell an interesting story. It&rsquo;s good to have overall scenic images to help give the viewer of feeling of the terrain or environment. Other images that help to tell the story are candid scenes that capture people doing things, portraits of the local people, and details. And, in a good travelogue, you will see images that depict the ambiance of a place &ndash; perhaps with atmosphere or mood.</p>\r\n<p>Since this is <em>your</em> story, and not a magazine assignment, anything that you want to photograph on your journey is fine. But if you want to capture the true spirit of the place, explore and focus on the local people doing local things, and not the resorts where the tourists hang out. So this class is about creating stories about our cultural travels. That said, these same concepts you&rsquo;ll learn here will be useful for any type of travel photograph, so when you do take a cruise or find yourself in a resort, you can make good pictures there, too!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>CREATING ENGAGING TRAVEL SCENES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Webster\'s English dictionary defines <em>engaging</em> as &lsquo;&hellip; pleasing in a way that holds your attention.&rsquo; Loosely defined then, a photograph that is engaging draws the viewer&rsquo;s attention, and holds it with interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your goal is to make travel scenes that engage the viewer&rsquo;s attention and express to them what you found interesting there. Here are some ideas to help you do that.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>COMPOSING FOR IMPACT</strong></p>\r\n<p>This first lesson is a rather long one, but creating engaging scenes involves many things, including good composition. Simply put, making use of the rule of thirds when composing can help make your images more compelling. Asymmetrical compositions are more stimulating to the brain, so placing your main subject off center typically creates a more interesting result than simply centering them. Yet placing your subject off to the right or left of center isn&rsquo;t a guarantee of a great picture. You also need to create a composition that uses the photographic frame efficiently, filling the space with information that supports your main subject or story. Everything in your frame has some visual weight; nothing is neutral, so you want to be sure to include only those elements that support your main idea, All the elements in your frame are important to each other, and your &lsquo;arrangement&rsquo; of them by where you stand, what you include in the frame, etc., is essential to think about when composing. Space and scale are important, too.</p>\r\n<p>For the image of Bar San Miguel below, it was a pretty easy composition decision, as he was standing there and I knew I wanted to include him and the sign above the doors.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The monk walking past the monastery wall in the image below, filled in the otherwise empty space. I included just enough architectural details for a sense of place, and waited for a monk to walk through, to add scale to the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>I liked the dappled light in this scene &ndash; it looked a bit like a diorama in a museum display. Watching this man plow his field, I composed for the scene with the implied horizon low to place him below the middle of the frame, and waited for him to walk in from the left.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>FIND A NEW VIEW</strong></p>\r\n<p>Look for unusual viewpoints or position. For this Cuban street scene with the classic American car, I realized that if I got low enough, on the ground in fact, I could get a reflection of the car in the puddle at the same time providing a rather unusual viewpoint of the street. I used my 16mm to include as much of the puddle and street as possible. (When the man came out of the doorway, even though he is subtle, it added human interest to the picture, too.)</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Of course you can also get low and look up, too, as I did here when the camel driver went by the pyramid. It makes the relationship more interesting between them.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Finding an elevated position is another way to create a more dramatic scenic photograph. When I travel, I look for opportunities to photograph from bell-towers, rooftop restaurants, and other high points to capture the &lsquo;broader view&rsquo; over cities and villages, or possibly over lush farmland. I often ask for a higher room in a hotel if I know the view is worth it. When I can get above it all, I\'ll often use a wide angle lens to capture the expansive view. But I\'ll also use my telephoto lenses, to pick out smaller details from that lofty viewpoint.</p>\r\n<p>For my pre-dawn photo of Havana, Cuba, I went to a 17th floor balcony of my hotel, as it enable me to capture a broad overview of the city in pretty light.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment7}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>In the photograph of the monastery, I simply walked up the steep stairs and turned around to get the picture. I liked the architecture and the shapes of the sunlight and shadows, but when the monks walked into the scene they made it even more interesting.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>The viewpoint over tannery vats in Fes, Morocco, was an excellent way to show the many vats in use dying leather, and the workers added human interest to the story as they went about their work.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>Walking along a canal in Thailand, I had a higher viewpoint to photograph these women preparing and selling their food to the locals. I loved how her hat echoed the circles of all her baskets of foods.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll see when you look over a wall, but I always explore! This carpet salesman was rolling up rugs he had displayed for potential customers and I just happened to capture the moment from a dynamic position.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment11}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>WORK WITH A WIDE ANGLE LENS</strong></p>\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have an unusual low or high viewpoint for everything, however. Even at eye level, there are great scenic images to capture. I love to use my lenses in the 16-28mm range for this. These lenses can capture the breadth of a scene when simply pointed at it, but when they do, they optically&nbsp; &lsquo;push&rsquo; everything further away from the camera. The end result is a picture that usually leaves the viewer feeling removed from the scene, rather than engaged by it. To remedy that problem, try including something in your foreground. It could be a person, an interesting sculpture, or some other object that is there. Move in close to that object to where it feels as if you could reach out and touch it. You may have to angle your lens downward to include it all now, but that tilted angle emphasizes the foreground and creates a visual steppingstone into the picture. Used creatively, a wide-angle lens can create a powerful composition. The Cuban watch repairman is a good example. I moved in close, angled the camera down slightly to emphasis the foreground of watch parts, and framed the scene to include the environment behind him to add a bit more sense of place.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I tilted my camera downward to emphasize the pattern of the bags of spices, and those visually pull you further into the scene to the vendor in the background, which completes the story in this picture.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment13}<br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I found this farmer plowing his fields in Cuba, and got in close and low with my 24mm, angling the camera upward and framing the farmer&rsquo;s head between the animals. The viewpoint makes the oxen loom large in the frame, so that it feels like they are bearing down on you; and in reality, they were very close!</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment14}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>CREATE VISUAL DEPTH</strong></p>\r\n<p>When we photograph we are translating a 3-dimension scene into a two-dimension picture. To bring back the dimension or depth that we saw in the scene, we often have to create a relationship between near and far elements in the frame. With elements up closer to the camera, and other things further away into the scene, there is a visual perspective or depth created that gives the viewer the feeling of being there, and that makes the picture more engaging. You can do this with any focal length lens up to about 70mm before you start to get visual compression. The general technique is to simply compose with something of interest closer to the camera, in relationship to other things further away. It is this &lsquo;near/far&rsquo; relationship that gives the illusion of depth, and can make your pictures far more interesting.</p>\r\n<p>The balloon vendor in Mexico creates a near/far relationship with the church, and was created using a 24mm, although not in so close as to have the balloons cover the church&rsquo;s facade.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>In the wide-angle section above, the pictures all have more depth by exaggerating the foreground&rsquo;s proportion in the frame to other things further back. This expands the visual depth. Yet you can work with other focal lengths to suggest depth in your picture, too.</p>\r\n<p>A good example is the field of poppies from Tuscany, made at 85mm focal length. By angling the camera down slightly, I created a larger proportion of the field in relationship to the house and sky beyond, which draws you across the field to the stone farmhouse.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}</p>\r\n<p>Selective focus is another way to suggest depth in a scene.</p>\r\n<p>For the picture of the offering tree in a Thai temple, I purposely kept my aperture wider, to throw the background out of focus, while still showing enough information to say &lsquo;temple&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment17}</p>\r\n<p>The square with bougainvillea was created using a 35mm equivalent of 300mm. Just keeping the background out of focus slightly visually separated the two elements, suggesting depth and placing emphasis on the flowers.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment18}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>USE LEADING LINES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Another way to create visual impact and suggest depth at the same time is to incorporate leading lines in your photograph. Roadways, paths, steps, and rows of trees &ndash; these are all elements that can help draw the viewer through your picture and create visual depth in the process. Leading lines force the viewer to enter the picture where you want them to, creating a strong impact.</p>\r\n<p>At this Bhutanese temple, I loved the pattern of the shadow and the way the railing curved towards the stupa; it gave a visual pathway to follow through a very pretty scene, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the monk appeared and stopped to take in the wonderful view that my picture was &lsquo;complete&rsquo;. He added so much to the sweeping scene I was composing. Would it have worked OK without him? Yes, but when you can add in human interest to your travel pictures, it can create more impact.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment19}</p>\r\n<p>The people harvesting rice created a lovely line through the fields, when viewed from the road above. This leads the eye past the cut rice.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment20}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>USING FRAMES FOR DEPTH</strong></p>\r\n<p>Similar to the near/far relationship discussed above, framing something with something else can suggest depth and create an unusual viewpoint at the same time. The image of the temple, when framed by the courtyard arch, created a graphic image and a feeling of depth.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment21}</p>\r\n<p>So too, did the unusual viewpoint of the church through the wrought-iron railing. They are fun ways to make different pictures and all the while bring dimension to your images/</p>\r\n<p>{attachment22}</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:44:42','2015-02-07 14:44:31','2015-02-07 15:44:42'),(106,40,'Storytelling Environmental and Up-Close Portraits',NULL,'<br />PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE WHILE TRAVELING<br />Photographing strangers can be the most difficult part of traveling for many people. When you return, you have beautiful images from your adventure - yet without close-in images of people, and people enhance both the travel experience and your travelogue that you create. You really want to capture the wonderful, weathered face of an old man, or the shy child hiding in the doorway of her home. How do you get those pictures?<br />This lesson will give you some ideas and tips for approaching strangers and practicing your skill at interacting with people.<br /><br />{attachment1}<br /><br />MAKING CONTACT<br /> Many photographers who are shy about photographing people equate the assertiveness required to get up close and personal as being obnoxious behavior. No matter what you were told while growing up, it is not rude to get in close to photograph someone you don&rsquo;t know. Many people are honored to be photographed, or at the very least comfortable with it, if approached in a non-threatening and gentle manner.<br />The first step &ndash; and the most important is to get past your own discomfort at approaching strangers. Why are most of us uncomfortable with the process? It usually has to do with our own self-consciousness. We assume that strangers will be \"shy\", or that they\'ll feel threatened by our approach, or maybe exploited. But usually, those assumptions come from projecting our feelings based on our learned protocol when growing up, or our own feelings about being photographed by a stranger (who would want to photograph me?).<br />The second step is quite simple: you just ask them if you can make a photograph. How do you do that if you don&rsquo;t speak the language? Although English is increasingly understood around the world, there are still many destinations where it won\'t help you. Learning just a few basic local phrases can go a long way to making friends in faraway places.<br />People genuinely appreciate the effort you make to speak to them in their language, and this can really set the stage for a great photograph.<br />Before I travel somewhere, I learn simple things, such as \"Hello,\" \"Please,\" \"Thank you,\" and \"May I?\" I\'ll also learn phrases like \"I\'m from ____\" and \"May I make a picture of you?\" Yet even a simple \"may I?\" with your camera raised and pointed towards them may be all you need.<br />OK, so now you\'ve tried out your language skills and the person you asked for a picture says or nods \"yes\"? What next? Try to keep up a conversation after you\'ve started to photograph. Don\'t worry if you only know a few phrases of their language.<br />Use your pantomime skills - from those good \'ole days of playing charades. It shows your desire to be friendly and can put them at ease with the humor that often develops with attempts at the language and gestures to communicate.<br />The key is to keep your subject comfortable while they are being photographed. Talk to them about what you are doing even if they don&rsquo;t speak or understand your language. The chatter keeps their attention focused on you. I also learn phrases such as &lsquo;please look at the lens&rsquo;, or &lsquo;look here&rsquo; if I want eye contact.<br />This all may seem daunting at first, but you must try if you want to make those memorable portraits of the faces of the place you are visiting. And don\'t take any \"no\" personally.<br /><br />MAKING THE BEST PHOTO<br /> Once people have said yes, many photographers hurry to get out of their subjects\' face. But what good is that if you return home with a missed image? Once you have someone\'s permission, you should expose more than one frame. Explain to them that you need to make a few photos. If you don\'t know the words for this, just keep holding up your hand as if to say \"One more, please! Try for the best photo possible in the situation. Take a deep breath, and slow yourself down! Watch out for those disturbing backgrounds that miraculously appear after we\'ve made the picture!<br /><br />TYPES OF PORTRAITS<br />There are three kinds of people photographs that bring you in close: a head shot; a three-quarter portrait, wherein you include the upper portion of their chest and shoulders along with their head; and the environmental portrait, where you are in close so yet you&rsquo;ve included something of their surroundings to add some story to the picture about who they are, or where they live.<br />To ease into photographing up-close, begin with an environmental portrait and then move in closer and closer, if they are comfortable. You can usually read their body language to tell you if it&rsquo;s still OK. This helps makes you more comfortable at the same time, and gives you an opportunity to check exposure, lighting, etc. on the first shot before you get in really close.<br />Some people prefer to just get in close first, and it&rsquo;s not a bad idea if your subject is &lsquo;on the move&rsquo; and you might not get more than one minute for a photo. I try to assess each situation as I&rsquo;m approaching the person. A vendor is sitting and waiting for buyers, so I&rsquo;ll have a bit more time. But someone walking down the lane, en route to somewhere, may not give me more than a half-minute so I have to work quickly! This is where having the knowledge of how to work your camera&rsquo;s controls quickly to get the right exposure and focus without much fuss is essential. You will lose their interest if you are fussing around with how to get your camera set up and that will show in the picture.<br />The Berber woman was at first unsure, but I told her she had a beautiful face. I meant it &ndash; uniquely interesting. That seemed to relax her a bit, and she allowed me to make this picture. Her eyes seemed to smile a bit through that weathered face. I moved around to position her against a more simple background that at least matched the colors of her clothing.<br />{attachment2}<br />The beautiful young monk in Myanmar was willing to let me make pictures, and his parasol added a wonderful graphic element to make the composition strong. I got in close to fill the frame with the umbrella, placing him slightly off center for more visual interest.<br />{attachment3}<br />The wonderful face of this Bhutanese man with his unique hat drew me in. I had to purchase a snack to get his permission, but it was worth it. The light falling on his face from his storefront window was lovely and separated him from the darker recesses of his tiny shop. The tilt of the hat gave a rather jaunty effect above his friendly face.<br />{attachment4}<br />Thought not entirely an environment portrait, I just loved the combination of colors to support his very interesting face. He was 85 years old and proud of it. His clothing helps to tell a story about him.<br />{attachment5}<br />The piece of meat hanging in the background tells the story of the meat vendor in this portrait. I loved his tattoos, and blue tank top against his warm-toned skin, but without that meat, you would know little about him.<br />{attachment6}<br />Sometimes you end up with two subjects in your frame, as this mother and daughter sitting on their front doorstep in Guatemala. I composed to include some of the house to show where they lived, and I loved how the clothing on the clotheslines matched their blouses. I look for details like that to help create a stronger environmental portrait.<br />{attachment7}<br />This hat maker in Morocco was surrounded on one side by all the hats he made &ndash; he was very industrious and was making one when I stopped to ask if I could photograph him. The left side of the picture was the alley I had walked up, and was distracting, so I framed him tighter against that edge and let the hats fill the rest of the frame to tell the story about him. I am always looking for photos like this when I&rsquo;m walking about the streets of any village. They tell you more about the people than a simple headshot will.<br />{attachment8}<br />Photographing in Morocco is not always so easy &ndash; but this chicken vendor was willing to show me his &lsquo;stock&rsquo;, so while he posed I zoomed back to include more of the environment of turkeys and chickens around him. I loved the rough texture on the walk &ndash; what a great background to simplify this picture. Tell people how much you like their products, even if you can&rsquo;t buy them. Proud vendors often make good pictures.<br />{attachment9}<br />We had made an appointment to come see this young Italian master violinist at work. But I treated it much like an environmental portrait, including his surroundings to tell the story of his trade. While not a true candid moment, and not a portrait, this type of picture still tells a great story.<br />{attachment10}<br /><br />PRACTICE YOUR TECHNIQUE<br />The more you practice, the better you&rsquo;ll get at making portraits, getting all the settings right at &lsquo;first go&rsquo; in order to be efficient so you don&rsquo;t lose your subject&rsquo;s attention or your subject entirely as they move on! To practice, start photographing strangers around your own hometown. Attend public festivals, or performances, and ask the performers if you can photograph them. They are used to being in the \"spotlight\" and this makes it easier for you to get used to approaching a stranger and asking permission. Another great place to practice is at a park where children are bound to be there with parents. Asking the proud parents\' permission often garners a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Now, if you can just get the child to agree!<br />When you receive permission, don&rsquo;t just make one picture! It is risky &ndash; they can blink, look away the instant you press the button, or you, being a bit nervous, might cause camera shake. Take your time to make the best picture you can.<br />Watch your background &ndash; for head-shoulder type portraits, I usually open my aperture to f5.6 or more to throw the background out of focus &ndash; and frame as tightly as possible to minimize distractions. For environmental portraits, I&rsquo;ll go the other direction, with a smaller aperture of f11 or more, so the background is in focus, or at least very distinguishable in the frame.<br />{attachment11}<br />Tip: The focal length you use when photographing people is an important consideration. Wide angles (20-28mm) are great for the environmental portrait, but they can cause unflattering distortion when getting in too close to your subject. Pay attention to how your subject looks in the frame, with wide-angles, and back off a bit if they are becoming too distorted. Then, switch to a normal focal length or a moderate telephoto of about 85-100mm to do the close-in portraits.  Longer telephotos will optically compress the face, (180-300mm range), which sometimes can be flattering. But you\'ll want to get the tip of the nose and the eyes sharp and will have to choose a smaller aperture that gives you that, while still keeping the background out of focus to place attention on the person.&nbsp; Generally, 50-150mm is the most effective range for close-in portraits. This gives you the most pleasing compression of features, and allows you to choose an aperture that keeps the person in focus while minimizing any details in the background.<br /><br />USING INTERESTING LIGHT FOR PORTRAITS<br />It&rsquo;s not always possible to control the light when you are walking around the village or town, but I look for certain things that will help me make a better picture. In the mornings or afternoons, I walk the streets that have sunlight striking one side of the street&rsquo;s buildings, as this light reflects into the shaded side of the street and can create wonderful bounce light to work with for any type of photo, but especially for people.<br />The light colored dirt outside a covered monastery doorway bounced enough light into this young monk&rsquo;s face to make it possible to photograph him, and it was beautiful light on a beautiful face for just a few moments before he lost interest in being photographed!<br />{attachment12}<br />This isn&rsquo;t to say that I will avoid other streets in total shade, but I love the bounce light when I can find it for portraits.<br />The soft light of a cloudy day or shade can make photographing people much easier. If they are in sun, I will often ask them to either turn around so their face is shaded, or to move into the shade for a better picture. Learning the phrase &lsquo;it&rsquo;s better&rsquo; in the language goes a long way to communicating why you are positioning them. Gentle nudging can also work but check the culture for proper protocol. For example, women cannot touch monks in most Buddhist countries.<br />This farmer loved his Brahma cow and naturally leaned on it when I went to make a picture. It was serendipitous that his shirt matched the background foliage, but I asked him to move there for a better background.<br />{attachment13}<br />In the case of the man sitting in his porch chair, it was the strong light that I loved &ndash; with his shadow stretching off to the right. It expressed of the strength of the Cuban sun, and the side light brought out the rougher texture of his face.<br />{attachment14}<br /><br />MAKE UNUSUAL PORTRAITS<br />It&rsquo;s fine to make straightforward portraits of people and most often that is what you will do. But when you can, try to think creatively about alternate ways to make a picture. For example, this young Bhutanese nun had just opened the door to go to lessons, and I saw the soft screen and how it affected the overall image of her behind it. I quickly asked her permission to photograph her. I had time for only three pictures before she had to leave, but I loved how the screen gave a soft texture to the picture.<br />{attachment15}<br />If you are still hesitant about approaching total strangers, try photographing people you interact with on a regular basis while you are traveling. People in service jobs, such as waiters, taxi drivers, shopkeepers - are all used to travelers. And while you are interacting with them for their services/products, you can also ask to make a picture of them. This works very well if you have paid them for their services, or tipped them, but it\'s not a requirement to getting a nice picture.<br />Tip: Give yourself an assignment so you can say \"I\'m photographing village life in rural Italy,\" or \"I\'m working on a visual presentation for my camera club.\" For some reason, this gives us justification to ask people for permission - as if the simple reason of making photographs because we are so fascinated or interested isn\'t enough!<br />Usually, the best light for people is soft, diffuse light, or reflected light, on their faces. Move them to lighting if possible, or just turn them so their face is more evenly lit in the shade. Find a better background if necessary. I know this isn\'t always possible, but it\'s worth a try. Also, if time permits, you can start with an image a little further away, to show them in their environment. This also acts as a warm-up for both you and your subject, and it gives you a chance to figure out what you want to do next. Then, move in closer, to capture a head and shoulder portrait.<br />It\'s all quite easy to photograph people, once you get used to the idea of approaching strangers. I truly believe that \"genuineness\" comes across in your mannerisms, in your approach. My camera is a license for me to be curious, and I am curious about people as much as the scenery when I travel.',90,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:16:14','2015-02-07 15:15:44','2015-02-07 15:16:14'),(107,40,'Travel Photos that Speak Your Voice',NULL,'You&rsquo;ve reached the last class of the course, and throughout the lessons you have received guidelines and tips to make better photographs of your travels, in a more documentary, straightforward way. But each of us has our own personal vision, or viewpoint, on the places we visit, and that vision should also be applied when making your pictures.   This lesson will be short, because in the interest of personal vision, it&rsquo;s all about you and how you interpret your world! But I have included examples of how I have seen things that are beyond the documentary image to give you ideas and share my own vision.   I encourage you to play a bit, to experiment with different shutter speeds, to find a unique point of view, and to push yourself to see in the most creative way you can while making the pictures. I also encourage you to apply your personal vision to the images afterwards, in post-processing.   You are the artist, the one capturing the moment, interpreting the scene before you, and you can do what you wish to the photographs for the final results.   Some of you might be in photography clubs or societies with competitions, and the rules for travel photography are often strict in saying that the picture must accurately represent what you saw &ndash; in the photojournalistic tradition. You can work within those guidelines to make the most realistic capture of the scene, while still providing creative viewpoints and gesture. But I like to go beyond those &lsquo;rules&rsquo; to express my feelings or my interpretations of a place, too, so I often have two versions of a scene &ndash; one that is most realistic with no effects, and one that has an &lsquo;effect&rsquo; &ndash; such as sepia or other monochromatic toning, or a touch of texture added, to bring the image out in a more artistic way. The choice is yours, but have some fun with your photography and experiment!  This unusual viewpoint of a fisherman breaks the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; but makes the picture more universal and more dynamic. We don&rsquo;t really need to see the whole man &ndash; and in fact if we did, we often go to the person&rsquo;s face, so here, it&rsquo;s about fishing on the breakfront with a touch of the city beyond, and just waiting for a moment of a wave to splash to add some &lsquo;moment&rsquo; to the scene.<br />{attachment1}<br />I love capturing motion in my images &ndash; the blur of hands playing the bongo drums tells the story of tropical music being played. This gives energy to the picture, makes it feel alive.<br />{attachment2}  In the image of the Moroccan women speeding by on her scooter, there is still a sense of place because of her clothing, and the surroundings, which tells a story about women becoming more modern and independent in Morocco, while adding interpretive expression to the photograph.<br />{attachment3}  Reflections are such fun to work with when photographing. While walking through an Irish town, I spotted the performers through the window, and loved the abstract reflection at dusk with the warm lights of the interior of the pub. I positioned myself to get the violinist in a clear enough area so the eye had something to move to as it went through the layers of reflection.<br />{attachment4}  I used the idea of reflection in this interior in Morocco, to both show the architecture and the furniture to give a sense of place to the detail. The scene has depth by use of the mirror.<br />{attachment5}<br />When walking by an old car, I saw people reflected in the window and liked the juxtaposition of the two, so I waited for someone wearing something red to walk by, to pick up the matching color.<br />{attachment6}  When I spotted this woman watching activity outside her lace-covered doorway, I was so excited! I loved how she was partially obscured by the lace, yet still visible, lending a bit of mystery to the image. It just added a more personal touch to the photograph, even though it&rsquo;s harder to tell much about the place. Sometimes you just need to make pictures because you like them without concern about whether they&rsquo;ll tell a particular story.<br />{attachment7}<br />I&rsquo;m always looking for details that tell a story, and while maybe not as obvious as the big picture &lsquo;story&rsquo;, they really add a lot to a slide show or book of your travels. This monk in a festival had new shoes &ndash; All-Stars sneakers! I loved the juxtaposition of them against his traditional robes.<br />{attachment8}  I love architectural details because of the design elements that you find in them. I still try to suggest a sense of place when possible, with my detail images, although it&rsquo;s not always possible, or obvious! In a restaurant atop the Atlas mountains of Morocco, I used the stairs and the window details to frame a graphic image that simply pleased me, regardless of whether it had &lsquo;value&rsquo; for my story on Morocco.<br />{attachment9}<br />I love a sepia look, but in this image I also added a dreamy soft glow to the image in post-processing, because Venice is romantic, nostalgic, and I wanted to express that. It still reads as a picture from Venice because of the iconic architecture and gondola, but with a personal vision.<br />{attachment10}  I applied a similar look to the accordion player in Italy. Tuscany also has that romantic, nostalgic feel, and it just seemed to fit my interpretation of the moment. This man was playing during a festival that celebrated the &lsquo;old memories&rsquo;!<br />{attachment11}  The image of the nun was fine in color, with her habit being blue and the walls being white with a terracotta band at the bottom, but to bring out the mood of the light more, I chose to convert this to a toned black and white.<br />{attachment12}<br />You have come to the close of this course in travel photography, and you have gained many insights into how you can make your travel pictures more creative and stronger in telling the story of your travels.

It can&rsquo;t always be perfect, when we travel, and so it&rsquo;s a good idea to learn to use the light you have and try to make pictures that work in that light. In my workshops, I often hear people say they couldn&rsquo;t be there for sunrise so the light wasn&rsquo;t great when they did get there. But maybe what&rsquo;s needed is to rethink what your photograph will be in the light you have. If you are at the Taj Mahal at the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; time of day, perhaps photographing details on the shady side of the mosque is the answer for getting a photograph that pleases you. If you can plan to be somewhere in the right light, you have the opportunity to make great pictures.<br />Learn to &lsquo;read&rsquo; the light. When you arrive somewhere, look at the quality of the light &ndash; i.e whether it&rsquo;s specular light with strong shadows, or diffused light with soft shadows, or completely flat light with little shadow. Look at what the light is doing on the subject you are interested in photographing. Is the light the appropriate for your scene or subject? Typically, large landscapes or scenics that have quite a bit of sky don&rsquo;t work well in overcast skies, as the sky becomes too light and with little details. Of course, dramatic clouds can make that an exception and add mood to the scene. If you have an overcast sky, try to compose a picture with little or no sky to eliminate the problem of having an area of the frame that is too light. More intimate landscapes and details and portraits are great with an overcast sky situation, so look for those types of photographs on cloudy days. Or, if you have the time, come back to the scene you want in better light, or think of another position or viewpoint to use the light you have in that moment. There is usually more than one right answer for many subjects you&rsquo;ll photograph, if you just get a little creative and think about changing your position and your composition.<br />Sometimes, you don&rsquo;t get the choice of the best light that you might want, but you can get lucky from time to time and have an image work out just fine. If you have interesting clouds to create dappled light, as I had here in the fields of Cuba in mid-morning, the contrast can work out just fine and the shadows will create dimension and separation of objects. I had to photograph when the farmer was there, so you work with what you have and hope the conditions are favorable.<br />{attachment1}<br /><br />LOW-LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY<br />Photographing during pre-dawn or dusk can yield fantastic photographs. I always try to look at the place I&rsquo;m visiting under dawn or dusk skies, as well as nighttime images, because they capture the mood and a different view of the place that most travelers see.<br />When you want to photograph a big city skyline, try planning your photo session for twilight, just after sunset, on a weekday. The cleaning crews work after everyone has gone for the day, and more lights are on in the buildings, making them more illuminated at dusk. On the weekends many lights are off in office buildings to save energy. Skylines at twilight are best photographed about 15-30 minutes after the sun has set, when exposure value of the twilight sky is in balance with the exposure value of the window lights. It is also a great time to photograph village lanes, street corners, shopping streets, etc. where you can include the sky for a rich blue contrast to the warm street and shop lights. You will always have overexposure here and there in this type of photo, as the source of the lights will be too bright, but you aim for the best overall exposure for the rest of the scene while trying to minimize the space given to any area that is too bright.<br />These same scenes can be captured in pre-dawn &lsquo;twilight&rsquo;, but in many places the light turn off just as the light is getting great, to my disappointment, and the office buildings are darker, too. I just prefer post-sunset twilight for that reason, but I still go out very early to capture what I can during the magic hour.<br />TIP: Light from most office buildings is fluorescent and yields a green color cast when your camera is set to daylight balance. Auto white-balance can help correct that, but it may also shift the color of the sky a bit, adding magenta to the picture to cancel the green in the lights.<br />I always bring out my tripod for low-light photography as it yields better results. I use mirror lock-up and the self-timer or my remote release to trip the shutter to minimize camera shake. I turn OFF vibration reduction (VR), also known as image stabilization (IS), unless the manufacture has confirmed that keeping it on while on a tripod is OK. (This is true for some newer lenses/cameras now)<br />Tip: If you have to hand hold your camera in low light situations, put the camera on continuous frame mode. Then, turn ON image stabilization (also known as vibration reduction) if you have it, squeeze the shutter button gently and hold it down for two or three pictures. The frames in the middle will typically be the sharpest - unaffected by the initial pressing of the shutter or the final letting up of it. Another method is to use exposure bracketing, set to just 1/3-stop difference, and the 2-second self timer. Pressing the shutter button then activates the timer, releases the shutter and three pictures are made in a sequence that are very close in exposure, so you can select the sharpest of the three. A beanbag is great if you have railings or other supports over which to drape it.&nbsp; Leaning against lampposts, pillars, etc. can work but I often find they aren&rsquo;t where I want to position myself for the composition!<br />Predawn in Tuscany meant getting up very early in May, but it was worth it. The valley had morning mist softly flowing through it, and the pink sky against the bluish land was so pretty. About 45 minutes before sunrise, you can find this sort of color balance if the atmospheric conditions are right. Mounted on my tripod, with the mirror locked up, I exposed for 6 seconds at f16.<br />{attachment2}<br />Dusk along the Arno river in Florence, Italy is a beautiful thing to experience and photograph. I exposed my image for 13 seconds at f16. The small aperture gave me the starburst effect on the lights, and the long exposure smoothed out the water surface a little bit.<br />{attachment3}<br />I often choose a minimum aperture of f11-f22 to keep my depth of field good, but it&rsquo;s not always possible. The aerial view of Bangkok at dusk was a six-second exposure at just f6.3. A bust of wind now and then at the 64th floor caused me concern about camera shake, so I kept the exposure as short as possible by using a wider aperture. But being as far away as I was from the scene below me, I knew that it would still keep everything sharp at the 26mm focal length I used.<br />{attachment4}<br />When night is falling, that rich twilight blue of the sky is beautiful when set against buildings that are lit. The church in Antigua&rsquo;s square shows how you can balance the artificial lights against that twilight sky. The exposure was 20 seconds, to keep my ISO low and reduce the potential for digital noise. The rainy street added visual interest, picking up the warm glow of the incandescent lights of the church.<br />{attachment5}<br />The central piazza in San Gimignano, Italy took on a more magical appearance at twilight, when the street lamps and the shop windows lit up against the deep blue sky. Exposed for 25 seconds, with an f16 aperture, I captured the mood of the nighttime scene. People that moved through the scene quickly dissappeared, making it look like no one was out that night.<br />{attachment6}<br />Contrast can be a useful thing, especially in black-and-white photography. But even in color, you can use the contrast to your advantage. Using the backlight coming in the doorway of the tobacco barn, I composed this silhouette of the farmer while he smoked his cigar. There were others photographing him straight on, but I liked this alternative view of the moment.<br />{attachment7}<br />I also used the high contrast situation on Inle Lake in Burma to my advantage. Underexposing a bit, I created an almost moonlit affect of this fisherman with his old nets.<br />{attachment8}<br />Likewise, the shadow of a passing woman against the red wall offset the old car and created a stronger picture. Without her the space would be empty and the composition off balance. Looking for and photographing shadows is a great way to use the sunlight you have in a creative way.<br />{attachment9}<br />Another type of light that I love to use is bounce light. It&rsquo;s typically the light that is reflecting off some sunlit wall or surface that lands on something opposite it, such as this Cuban fruit seller. The warm glowing light was from the morning light striking the opposite walls that had soft yellow paint, and it struck his body with beautiful warm light, and filled in the shadows of his shop. This is beautiful light to work with for portraits but it also work really well for any travel scene or detail.<br />{attachment10}<br />The young Buddhist monks were illuminated by one large window to the left. Indirect light like this can be wonderful for photographing people indoors.<br />{attachment11}<br /><br />ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS<br />Fog, snow, rain, and storm light can create wonderful atmospheric results and I love to be out in it when there&rsquo;s weather happening.<br />On morning along the Malec&oacute;n in Havana, Cuba, the waves were crashing against the sea wall and the sun was just rising. It struck the splash of the wave in that instant and it was amazing against the stormy gray sky behind. It was luck that the wave happened to explode just as the sun broke through some clouds, but you&rsquo;ll never get lucky if you don&rsquo;t go out during stormy conditions.<br />{attachment12}<br />The drama of a storm displayed itself over the town, and I just happened to be up in a tower for an elevated viewpoint. The rain curtain and the billowing grey clouds added drama and interest to the scene.<br />{attachment13}<br />Fog is one of those atmospheric conditions that has a magical quality to it. It can be light and ethereal, or dark and somber in effect. This one morning in Italy the fog was pouring over the crest of the hill, and the sun broke through to illuminate it from within, adding a warm glow to the scene.<br />{attachment14}<br />On another morning, in a nearby location, we had fog again, but no sunlight and the effect is totally different, although still wonderful.<br />{attachment15}<br /><br />INTERIOR PHOTOGRAPHY<br />For all interiors, you can choose to filter the color of the light by changing your white balance, but I often prefer the mixed colors that I get with daylight white balance, as it adds interest. It all depends on the scene. For interiors you typically must have a tripod, but when on the go I have sometimes found I&rsquo;m without mine when I duck into a church or other building while walking about in the middle of the day, so I use the methods above to try and stabilize and push the ISO high to get the photo. You will always have overexposed highlights with this type of picture as the source of the light will be too bright, so you just want to work with the best overall exposure possible to get the details in the shadows and such to show.<br />For this image of the master violinmaker, I knew that the lightbulb would overexpose, but the light from it illuminated him and the cello panel he was working on, and that was most important. I pushed my ISO to 1000 and exposed at f4 for 1/80 sec, allowing his hand to blur to show the action of planing while keeping the rest sharp.<br />{attachment16}',83,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:29:54','2015-02-07 15:21:02','2015-02-07 15:29:54'),(109,40,'Storytelling Environmental and Up-Close Portraits',NULL,'<p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE WHILE TRAVELING</strong></p>\r\n<p>Photographing strangers can be the most difficult part of traveling for many people. When you return, you have beautiful images from your adventure - yet without close-in images of people, and people enhance both the travel experience and your travelogue that you create. You really want to capture the wonderful, weathered face of an old man, or the shy child hiding in the doorway of her home. How do you get those pictures?</p>\r\n<p>This lesson will give you some ideas and tips for approaching strangers and practicing your skill at interacting with people.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>MAKING CONTACT</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong>Many photographers who are shy about photographing people equate the assertiveness required to get up close and personal as being obnoxious behavior. No matter what you were told while growing up, it is not rude to get in close to photograph someone you don&rsquo;t know. Many people are honored to be photographed, or at the very least comfortable with it, if approached in a non-threatening and gentle manner.</p>\r\n<p>The first step &ndash; and the most important is to get past your own discomfort at approaching strangers. Why are most of us uncomfortable with the process? It usually has to do with our own self-consciousness. We assume that strangers will be \"shy\", or that they\'ll feel threatened by our approach, or maybe exploited. But usually, those assumptions come from projecting our feelings based on our learned protocol when growing up, or our own feelings about being photographed by a stranger (who would want to photograph me?).</p>\r\n<p>The second step is quite simple: you just ask them if you can make a photograph. How do you do that if you don&rsquo;t speak the language? Although English is increasingly understood around the world, there are still many destinations where it won\'t help you. Learning just a few basic local phrases can go a long way to making friends in faraway places.</p>\r\n<p>People genuinely appreciate the effort you make to speak to them in their language, and this can really set the stage for a great photograph.</p>\r\n<p>Before I travel somewhere, I learn simple things, such as \"Hello,\" \"Please,\" \"Thank you,\" and \"May I?\" I\'ll also learn phrases like \"I\'m from ____\" and \"May I make a picture of you?\" Yet even a simple \"may I?\" with your camera raised and pointed towards them may be all you need.</p>\r\n<p>OK, so now you\'ve tried out your language skills and the person you asked for a picture says or nods \"yes\"? What next? Try to keep up a conversation after you\'ve started to photograph. Don\'t worry if you only know a few phrases of their language.</p>\r\n<p>Use your pantomime skills - from those good \'ole days of playing charades. It shows your desire to be friendly and can put them at ease with the humor that often develops with attempts at the language and gestures to communicate.</p>\r\n<p>The key is to keep your subject comfortable while they are being photographed. Talk to them about what you are doing even if they don&rsquo;t speak or understand your language. The chatter keeps their attention focused on you. I also learn phrases such as &lsquo;please look at the lens&rsquo;, or &lsquo;look here&rsquo; if I want eye contact.</p>\r\n<p>This all may seem daunting at first, but you must try if you want to make those memorable portraits of the faces of the place you are visiting. And don\'t take any \"no\" personally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>MAKING THE BEST PHOTO</strong></p>\r\n<p> Once people have said yes, many photographers hurry to get out of their subjects\' face. But what good is that if you return home with a missed image? Once you have someone\'s permission, you should expose more than one frame. Explain to them that you need to make a few photos. If you don\'t know the words for this, just keep holding up your hand as if to say \"One more, please! Try for the best photo possible in the situation. Take a deep breath, and slow yourself down! Watch out for those disturbing backgrounds that miraculously appear after we\'ve made the picture!</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>TYPES OF PORTRAITS</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are three kinds of people photographs that bring you in close: a head shot; a three-quarter portrait, wherein you include the upper portion of their chest and shoulders along with their head; and the environmental portrait, where you are in close so yet you&rsquo;ve included something of their surroundings to add some story to the picture about who they are, or where they live.</p>\r\n<p>To ease into photographing up-close, begin with an environmental portrait and then move in closer and closer, if they are comfortable. You can usually read their body language to tell you if it&rsquo;s still OK. This helps makes you more comfortable at the same time, and gives you an opportunity to check exposure, lighting, etc. on the first shot before you get in really close.</p>\r\n<p>Some people prefer to just get in close first, and it&rsquo;s not a bad idea if your subject is &lsquo;on the move&rsquo; and you might not get more than one minute for a photo. I try to assess each situation as I&rsquo;m approaching the person. A vendor is sitting and waiting for buyers, so I&rsquo;ll have a bit more time. But someone walking down the lane, en route to somewhere, may not give me more than a half-minute so I have to work quickly! This is where having the knowledge of how to work your camera&rsquo;s controls quickly to get the right exposure and focus without much fuss is essential. You will lose their interest if you are fussing around with how to get your camera set up and that will show in the picture.</p>\r\n<p>The Berber woman was at first unsure, but I told her she had a beautiful face. I meant it &ndash; uniquely interesting. That seemed to relax her a bit, and she allowed me to make this picture. Her eyes seemed to smile a bit through that weathered face. I moved around to position her against a more simple background that at least matched the colors of her clothing.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment2}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The beautiful young monk in Myanmar was willing to let me make pictures, and his parasol added a wonderful graphic element to make the composition strong. I got in close to fill the frame with the umbrella, placing him slightly off center for more visual interest.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment3}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The wonderful face of this Bhutanese man with his unique hat drew me in. I had to purchase a snack to get his permission, but it was worth it. The light falling on his face from his storefront window was lovely and separated him from the darker recesses of his tiny shop. The tilt of the hat gave a rather jaunty effect above his friendly face.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment4}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Thought not entirely an environment portrait, I just loved the combination of colors to support his very interesting face. He was 85 years old and proud of it. His clothing helps to tell a story about him.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The piece of meat hanging in the background tells the story of the meat vendor in this portrait. I loved his tattoos, and blue tank top against his warm-toned skin, but without that meat, you would know little about him.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment6}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Sometimes you end up with two subjects in your frame, as this mother and daughter sitting on their front doorstep in Guatemala. I composed to include some of the house to show where they lived, and I loved how the clothing on the clotheslines matched their blouses. I look for details like that to help create a stronger environmental portrait.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>This hat maker in Morocco was surrounded on one side by all the hats he made &ndash; he was very industrious and was making one when I stopped to ask if I could photograph him. The left side of the picture was the alley I had walked up, and was distracting, so I framed him tighter against that edge and let the hats fill the rest of the frame to tell the story about him. I am always looking for photos like this when I&rsquo;m walking about the streets of any village. They tell you more about the people than a simple headshot will.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Photographing in Morocco is not always so easy &ndash; but this chicken vendor was willing to show me his &lsquo;stock&rsquo;, so while he posed I zoomed back to include more of the environment of turkeys and chickens around him. I loved the rough texture on the walk &ndash; what a great background to simplify this picture. Tell people how much you like their products, even if you can&rsquo;t buy them. Proud vendors often make good pictures.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>We had made an appointment to come see this young Italian master violinist at work. But I treated it much like an environmental portrait, including his surroundings to tell the story of his trade. While not a true candid moment, and not a portrait, this type of picture still tells a great story.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PRACTICE YOUR TECHNIQUE</strong></p>\r\n<p>The more you practice, the better you&rsquo;ll get at making portraits, getting all the settings right at &lsquo;first go&rsquo; in order to be efficient so you don&rsquo;t lose your subject&rsquo;s attention or your subject entirely as they move on! To practice, start photographing strangers around your own hometown. Attend public festivals, or performances, and ask the performers if you can photograph them. They are used to being in the \"spotlight\" and this makes it easier for you to get used to approaching a stranger and asking permission. Another great place to practice is at a park where children are bound to be there with parents. Asking the proud parents\' permission often garners a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Now, if you can just get the child to agree!</p>\r\n<p>When you receive permission, don&rsquo;t just make one picture! It is risky &ndash; they can blink, look away the instant you press the button, or you, being a bit nervous, might cause camera shake. Take your time to make the best picture you can.</p>\r\n<p>Watch your background &ndash; for head-shoulder type portraits, I usually open my aperture to f5.6 or more to throw the background out of focus &ndash; and frame as tightly as possible to minimize distractions. For environmental portraits, I&rsquo;ll go the other direction, with a smaller aperture of f11 or more, so the background is in focus, or at least very distinguishable in the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tip:</strong> <em>The focal length you use when photographing people is an important consideration. Wide angles (20-28mm) are great for the environmental portrait, but they can cause unflattering distortion when getting in too close to your subject. Pay attention to how your subject looks in the frame, with wide-angles, and back off a bit if they are becoming too distorted. Then, switch to a normal focal length or a moderate telephoto of about 85-100mm to do the close-in portraits.</em></span><br /><br />Longer telephotos will optically compress the face, (180-300mm range), which sometimes can be flattering. But you\'ll want to get the tip of the nose and the eyes sharp and will have to choose a smaller aperture that gives you that, while still keeping the background out of focus to place attention on the person.&nbsp; Generally, 50-150mm is the most effective range for close-in portraits. This gives you the most pleasing compression of features, and allows you to choose an aperture that keeps the person in focus while minimizing any details in the background.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>USING INTERESTING LIGHT FOR PORTRAITS</strong></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not always possible to control the light when you are walking around the village or town, but I look for certain things that will help me make a better picture. In the mornings or afternoons, I walk the streets that have sunlight striking one side of the street&rsquo;s buildings, as this light reflects into the shaded side of the street and can create wonderful bounce light to work with for any type of photo, but especially for people.</p>\r\n<p>The light colored dirt outside a covered monastery doorway bounced enough light into this young monk&rsquo;s face to make it possible to photograph him, and it was beautiful light on a beautiful face for just a few moments before he lost interest in being photographed!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that I will avoid other streets in total shade, but I love the bounce light when I can find it for portraits.</p>\r\n<p>The soft light of a cloudy day or shade can make photographing people much easier. If they are in sun, I will often ask them to either turn around so their face is shaded, or to move into the shade for a better picture. Learning the phrase &lsquo;it&rsquo;s better&rsquo; in the language goes a long way to communicating why you are positioning them. Gentle nudging can also work but check the culture for proper protocol. For example, women cannot touch monks in most Buddhist countries.</p>\r\n<p>This farmer loved his Brahma cow and naturally leaned on it when I went to make a picture. It was serendipitous that his shirt matched the background foliage, but I asked him to move there for a better background.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>In the case of the man sitting in his porch chair, it was the strong light that I loved &ndash; with his shadow stretching off to the right. It expressed of the strength of the Cuban sun, and the side light brought out the rougher texture of his face.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment14}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>MAKE UNUSUAL PORTRAITS</strong></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fine to make straightforward portraits of people and most often that is what you will do. But when you can, try to think creatively about alternate ways to make a picture. For example, this young Bhutanese nun had just opened the door to go to lessons, and I saw the soft screen and how it affected the overall image of her behind it. I quickly asked her permission to photograph her. I had time for only three pictures before she had to leave, but I loved how the screen gave a soft texture to the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>If you are still hesitant about approaching total strangers, try photographing people you interact with on a regular basis while you are traveling. People in service jobs, such as waiters, taxi drivers, shopkeepers - are all used to travelers. And while you are interacting with them for their services/products, you can also ask to make a picture of them. This works very well if you have paid them for their services, or tipped them, but it\'s not a requirement to getting a nice picture.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tip:</strong><em> Give yourself an assignment so you can say \"I\'m photographing village life in rural Italy,\" or \"I\'m working on a visual presentation for my camera club.\" For some reason, this gives us justification to ask people for permission - as if the simple reason of making photographs because we are so fascinated or interested isn\'t enough!</em></span></p>\r\n<p>Usually, the best light for people is soft, diffuse light, or reflected light, on their faces. Move them to lighting if possible, or just turn them so their face is more evenly lit in the shade. Find a better background if necessary. I know this isn\'t always possible, but it\'s worth a try. Also, if time permits, you can start with an image a little further away, to show them in their environment. This also acts as a warm-up for both you and your subject, and it gives you a chance to figure out what you want to do next. Then, move in closer, to capture a head and shoulder portrait.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s all quite easy to photograph people, once you get used to the idea of approaching strangers. I truly believe that \"genuineness\" comes across in your mannerisms, in your approach. My camera is a license for me to be curious, and I am curious about people as much as the scenery when I travel.</p>',83,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:44:47','2015-02-07 15:28:33','2015-02-07 15:44:47'),(110,40,'Capturing Moments of Daily life, Festivals and Rituals',NULL,'<p>Nothing expresses a culture better than candid images of everyday life.

There&rsquo;s an expression of peacefulness on the baby&rsquo;s face that contrasts with the bustling market around him.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment3}<br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In another market scene elsewhere, an old man carefully tucks in a rose to the bouquet as he prepares them for market. The light illuminated him in a way that drew my attention to his actions. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>GESTURE AND BODY LANGUAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Gesture is a pivotal element in a candid image because it provides the moment.</p>\r\n<p>It might be as simple as a wave of a hand, a smile, a foot lifted off the pavement, or an expression on someone\'s face. But these animations express a moment in time that you can capture, and they make the picture more expressive.</p>\r\n<p>The Cuban man smoking his morning cigar outside his home was a great photo opportunity. He was standing there enjoying his morning cigar, and I was working various compositions when the door opened and his wife peaked out to see whom he was talking to. She retreated soon after, but I managed to get a real moment and juxtaposition of the two of them.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Behind the scenes at a Bhutanese festival, we had great opportunities to watch them dress in their elaborate costumes for ritual dances. When the one guy stuck his finger firmly on the tied neck cord, I seized the moment. That single gesture makes the picture expressive.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment5}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Often people do repetitive actions. This Latin-American Indian woman was doing her ritualistic prayers, and swung the incense burn back and forth. All I had to do was get in the rhythm of her swing, and time it to get the can showing and the smoke billowing just right. I made many pictures trying to get the right timing on this moment.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment6}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Something about the body language on these two children was irresistible for me. They acted like adults in small bodies the way they sauntered along the cobblestone. It&rsquo;s a simple picture, but their gestures are strong.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment7}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The body language on this commuter in Venice told the story of soaking up the morning sun while riding to work past iconic buildings, that to him might have been just another building. By including the edge of the boat and some piece of architecture beyond that was recognizable, I could give this picture a sense of place while capturing the moment.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment8}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Often, the pictures are on the fringe of other activity. We were photographing fisherman demonstrating their technique in Myanmar, and while the group was working with two other men, these two were sitting on their boats and taking a break. It was a natural moment that is one of my favorite pictures from that morning.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment9}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Candid moments can be about juxtaposition, too. This man was whistling, and he pursed his lips like one of the caricature drawings. Even his profile reminded me of the style of his drawings and I grabbed the moment of the comical juxtaposition.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment10}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>You can make an otherwise static detail come to life with a suggested moment. These prayer wheels were a lovely detail image of the temple, but the picture was lacking something. When an old woman walked by and spun the wheels, it spun for a little while after she moved on, just enough for me to capture the invisible hand.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment11}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>When you travel, it\'s not always easy to blend in. I am blonde-haired and blue-eyed. I only \"fit in\" in Europe, Scandinavia, or the US. But I have found that in markets and festivals, the longer I stay in one place, the more invisible I become. Action returns to normal after the effect of the stranger wears off. That\'s when I can make my best images. This can work for you, too. We all become invisible after we stay in a place for any length of time, and that gives us an opportunity to be the proverbial &lsquo;fly on the wall&rsquo; and make some great candid moments. Other ways to blend in are to wear a local style hat, or scarf. Wearing safari clothing in the middle of France seems out of place and marks us as a tourist immediately, so anything you can do to dress like the locals gives you a better chance of blending in a bit more.</p>',83,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:44:51','2015-02-07 15:33:16','2015-02-07 15:44:51'),(111,40,'Framing with a Sense of Design',NULL,'x',83,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:41:32','2015-02-07 15:38:10','2015-02-07 15:41:32'),(112,40,'Stunning Photos Whatever the Light',NULL,'x',83,7,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:41:38','2015-02-07 15:39:30','2015-02-07 15:41:38'),(113,41,'Creating with Lenses and Perspectives',NULL,'<p><strong>INTRODUCTION:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Travel. The mere word conjures up exciting images in our minds. As traveling photographers, we want to bring back pictures that will visually express our impression of a place. You might be planning to create a book of your journey, or a visual presentation that you can show on your computer or TV. Or, maybe you just want to make images that have the impact you felt when you experienced the place. Whatever the reason, you want to make engaging pictures that express a sense of place.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to good composition, light, proper exposure, etc., travel photographs also need to contain information that tells the viewer about the place. What was the scenery like? What do the people look like, or dress like? What are their daily activities? What are the details that capture the very &lsquo;fabric&rsquo; of a culture? Imagine the challenge if you tried to do that in just one photograph! Thankfully, we get to make many pictures of a place when we travel, and these, combined, can create a wonderful narrative of our travels.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>If you approach your photography with the idea of telling a story, and the pictures you make will be the result of your thinking creatively, anticipation skills, and being a keen observer of your surroundings. It&rsquo;s a bit like writing, wherein you answer the &lsquo;who, what, when and where&rsquo; questions to tell your story. In photographs, we can do the same sort of thing. So, keep those in mind as we go forward through the lessons.</p>\r\n<p>There are several different &lsquo;types&rsquo; of pictures that, when combined into an essay, tell an interesting story. It&rsquo;s good to have overall scenic images to help give the viewer of feeling of the terrain or environment. Other images that help to tell the story are candid scenes that capture people doing things, portraits of the local people, and details. And, in a good travelogue, you will see images that depict the ambiance of a place &ndash; perhaps with atmosphere or mood.</p>\r\n<p>Since this is <em>your</em> story, and not a magazine assignment, anything that you want to photograph on your journey is fine. But if you want to capture the true spirit of the place, explore and focus on the local people doing local things, and not the resorts where the tourists hang out. So this class is about creating stories about our cultural travels. That said, these same concepts you&rsquo;ll learn here will be useful for any type of travel photograph, so when you do take a cruise or find yourself in a resort, you can make good pictures there, too!</p>\r\n<p><strong>CREATING ENGAGING TRAVEL SCENES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Webster\'s English dictionary defines <em>engaging</em> as &lsquo;&hellip; pleasing in a way that holds your attention.&rsquo; Loosely defined then, a photograph that is engaging draws the viewer&rsquo;s attention, and holds it with interest.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Your goal is to make travel scenes that engage the viewer&rsquo;s attention and express to them what you found interesting there. Here are some ideas to help you do that<br /><br /><strong>COMPOSING FOR IMPACT</strong></p>\r\n<p>This first lesson is a rather long one, but creating engaging scenes involves many things, including good composition. Simply put, making use of the rule of thirds when composing can help make your images more compelling. Asymmetrical compositions are more stimulating to the brain, so placing your main subject off center typically creates a more interesting result than simply centering them. Yet placing your subject off to the right or left of center isn&rsquo;t a guarantee of a great picture. You also need to create a composition that uses the photographic frame efficiently, filling the space with information that supports your main subject or story. Everything in your frame has some visual weight; nothing is neutral, so you want to be sure to include only those elements that support your main idea, All the elements in your frame are important to each other, and your &lsquo;arrangement&rsquo; of them by where you stand, what you include in the frame, etc., is essential to think about when composing. Space and scale are important, too.</p>\r\n<p>For the image of Bar San Miguel below, it was a pretty easy composition decision, as he was standing there and I knew I wanted to include him and the sign above the doors.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The monk walking past the monastery wall in the image below, filled in the otherwise empty space. I included just enough architectural details for a sense of place, and waited for a monk to walk through, to add scale to the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>I liked the dappled light in this scene &ndash; it looked a bit like a diorama in a museum display. Watching this man plow his field, I composed for the scene with the implied horizon low to place him below the middle of the frame, and waited for him to walk in from the left.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}<br /><strong><br />FIND A NEW VIEW</strong></p>\r\n<p>Look for unusual viewpoints or position. For this Cuban street scene with the classic American car, I realized that if I got low enough, on the ground in fact, I could get a reflection of the car in the puddle at the same time providing a rather unusual viewpoint of the street. I used my 16mm to include as much of the puddle and street as possible. (When the man came out of the doorway, even though he is subtle, it added human interest to the picture, too.)</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Of course you can also get low and look up, too, as I did here when the camel driver went by the pyramid. It makes the relationship more interesting between them.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Finding an elevated position is another way to create a more dramatic scenic photograph. When I travel, I look for opportunities to photograph from bell-towers, rooftop restaurants, and other high points to capture the &lsquo;broader view&rsquo; over cities and villages, or possibly over lush farmland. I often ask for a higher room in a hotel if I know the view is worth it. When I can get above it all, I\'ll often use a wide angle lens to capture the expansive view. But I\'ll also use my telephoto lenses, to pick out smaller details from that lofty viewpoint.</p>\r\n<p>For my pre-dawn photo of Havana, Cuba, I went to a 17th floor balcony of my hotel, as it enable me to capture a broad overview of the city in pretty light.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment7}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>In the photograph of the monastery, I simply walked up the steep stairs and turned around to get the picture. I liked the architecture and the shapes of the sunlight and shadows, but when the monks walked into the scene they made it even more interesting.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>The viewpoint over tannery vats in Fes, Morocco, was an excellent way to show the many vats in use dying leather, and the workers added human interest to the story as they went about their work.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>Walking along a canal in Thailand, I had a higher viewpoint to photograph these women preparing and selling their food to the locals. I loved how her hat echoed the circles of all her baskets of foods.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;ll see when you look over a wall, but I always explore! This carpet salesman was rolling up rugs he had displayed for potential customers and I just happened to capture the moment from a dynamic position.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment11}</span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>WORK WITH A WIDE ANGLE LENS</strong></p>\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t have to have an unusual low or high viewpoint for everything, however. Even at eye level, there are great scenic images to capture. I love to use my lenses in the 16-28mm range for this. These lenses can capture the breadth of a scene when simply pointed at it, but when they do, they optically&nbsp; &lsquo;push&rsquo; everything further away from the camera. The end result is a picture that usually leaves the viewer feeling removed from the scene, rather than engaged by it. To remedy that problem, try including something in your foreground. It could be a person, an interesting sculpture, or some other object that is there. Move in close to that object to where it feels as if you could reach out and touch it. You may have to angle your lens downward to include it all now, but that tilted angle emphasizes the foreground and creates a visual steppingstone into the picture. Used creatively, a wide-angle lens can create a powerful composition. The Cuban watch repairman is a good example. I moved in close, angled the camera down slightly to emphasis the foreground of watch parts, and framed the scene to include the environment behind him to add a bit more sense of place.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I tilted my camera downward to emphasize the pattern of the bags of spices, and those visually pull you further into the scene to the vendor in the background, which completes the story in this picture.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment13}<br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">I found this farmer plowing his fields in Cuba, and got in close and low with my 24mm, angling the camera upward and framing the farmer&rsquo;s head between the animals. The viewpoint makes the oxen loom large in the frame, so that it feels like they are bearing down on you; and in reality, they were very close!</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment14}</span></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>CREATE VISUAL DEPTH</strong></p>\r\n<p>When we photograph we are translating a 3-dimension scene into a two-dimension picture. To bring back the dimension or depth that we saw in the scene, we often have to create a relationship between near and far elements in the frame. With elements up closer to the camera, and other things further away into the scene, there is a visual perspective or depth created that gives the viewer the feeling of being there, and that makes the picture more engaging. You can do this with any focal length lens up to about 70mm before you start to get visual compression. The general technique is to simply compose with something of interest closer to the camera, in relationship to other things further away. It is this &lsquo;near/far&rsquo; relationship that gives the illusion of depth, and can make your pictures far more interesting.</p>\r\n<p>The balloon vendor in Mexico creates a near/far relationship with the church, and was created using a 24mm, although not in so close as to have the balloons cover the church&rsquo;s facade.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>In the wide-angle section above, the pictures all have more depth by exaggerating the foreground&rsquo;s proportion in the frame to other things further back. This expands the visual depth. Yet you can work with other focal lengths to suggest depth in your picture, too.</p>\r\n<p>A good example is the field of poppies from Tuscany, made at 85mm focal length. By angling the camera down slightly, I created a larger proportion of the field in relationship to the house and sky beyond, which draws you across the field to the stone farmhouse.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}</p>\r\n<p>Selective focus is another way to suggest depth in a scene.</p>\r\n<p>For the picture of the offering tree in a Thai temple, I purposely kept my aperture wider, to throw the background out of focus, while still showing enough information to say &lsquo;temple&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment17}</p>\r\n<p>The square with bougainvillea was created using a 35mm equivalent of 300mm. Just keeping the background out of focus slightly visually separated the two elements, suggesting depth and placing emphasis on the flowers.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment18}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;USE LEADING LINES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Another way to create visual impact and suggest depth at the same time is to incorporate leading lines in your photograph. Roadways, paths, steps, and rows of trees &ndash; these are all elements that can help draw the viewer through your picture and create visual depth in the process. Leading lines force the viewer to enter the picture where you want them to, creating a strong impact.</p>\r\n<p>At this Bhutanese temple, I loved the pattern of the shadow and the way the railing curved towards the stupa; it gave a visual pathway to follow through a very pretty scene, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the monk appeared and stopped to take in the wonderful view that my picture was &lsquo;complete&rsquo;. He added so much to the sweeping scene I was composing. Would it have worked OK without him? Yes, but when you can add in human interest to your travel pictures, it can create more impact.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment19}</p>\r\n<p>The people harvesting rice created a lovely line through the fields, when viewed from the road above. This leads the eye past the cut rice.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment20}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>USING FRAMES FOR DEPTH</strong></p>\r\n<p>Similar to the near/far relationship discussed above, framing something with something else can suggest depth and create an unusual viewpoint at the same time. The image of the temple, when framed by the courtyard arch, created a graphic image and a feeling of depth.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment21}</p>\r\n<p>So too, did the unusual viewpoint of the church through the wrought-iron railing. They are fun ways to make different pictures and all the while bring dimension to your images/</p>\r\n<p>{attachment22}</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:49:22','2015-02-23 11:07:28'),(114,41,'Storytelling Environmental and Up-Close Portraits',NULL,'<p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHING PEOPLE WHILE TRAVELING</strong></p>\r\n<p>Photographing strangers can be the most difficult part of traveling for many people. When you return, you have beautiful images from your adventure - yet without close-in images of people, and people enhance both the travel experience and your travelogue that you create. You really want to capture the wonderful, weathered face of an old man, or the shy child hiding in the doorway of her home. How do you get those pictures?</p>\r\n<p>This lesson will give you some ideas and tips for approaching strangers and practicing your skill at interacting with people.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>MAKING CONTACT</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong>Many photographers who are shy about photographing people equate the assertiveness required to get up close and personal as being obnoxious behavior. No matter what you were told while growing up, it is not rude to get in close to photograph someone you don&rsquo;t know. Many people are honored to be photographed, or at the very least comfortable with it, if approached in a non-threatening and gentle manner.</p>\r\n<p>The first step &ndash; and the most important is to get past your own discomfort at approaching strangers. Why are most of us uncomfortable with the process? It usually has to do with our own self-consciousness. We assume that strangers will be \"shy\", or that they\'ll feel threatened by our approach, or maybe exploited. But usually, those assumptions come from projecting our feelings based on our learned protocol when growing up, or our own feelings about being photographed by a stranger (who would want to photograph me?).</p>\r\n<p>The second step is quite simple: you just ask them if you can make a photograph. How do you do that if you don&rsquo;t speak the language? Although English is increasingly understood around the world, there are still many destinations where it won\'t help you. Learning just a few basic local phrases can go a long way to making friends in faraway places.</p>\r\n<p>People genuinely appreciate the effort you make to speak to them in their language, and this can really set the stage for a great photograph.</p>\r\n<p>Before I travel somewhere, I learn simple things, such as \"Hello,\" \"Please,\" \"Thank you,\" and \"May I?\" I\'ll also learn phrases like \"I\'m from ____\" and \"May I make a picture of you?\" Yet even a simple \"may I?\" with your camera raised and pointed towards them may be all you need.</p>\r\n<p>OK, so now you\'ve tried out your language skills and the person you asked for a picture says or nods \"yes\"? What next? Try to keep up a conversation after you\'ve started to photograph. Don\'t worry if you only know a few phrases of their language.</p>\r\n<p>Use your pantomime skills - from those good \'ole days of playing charades. It shows your desire to be friendly and can put them at ease with the humor that often develops with attempts at the language and gestures to communicate.</p>\r\n<p>The key is to keep your subject comfortable while they are being photographed. Talk to them about what you are doing even if they don&rsquo;t speak or understand your language. The chatter keeps their attention focused on you. I also learn phrases such as &lsquo;please look at the lens&rsquo;, or &lsquo;look here&rsquo; if I want eye contact.</p>\r\n<p>This all may seem daunting at first, but you must try if you want to make those memorable portraits of the faces of the place you are visiting. And don\'t take any \"no\" personally.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>MAKING THE BEST PHOTO</strong></p>\r\n<p> Once people have said yes, many photographers hurry to get out of their subjects\' face. But what good is that if you return home with a missed image? Once you have someone\'s permission, you should expose more than one frame. Explain to them that you need to make a few photos. If you don\'t know the words for this, just keep holding up your hand as if to say \"One more, please! Try for the best photo possible in the situation. Take a deep breath, and slow yourself down! Watch out for those disturbing backgrounds that miraculously appear after we\'ve made the picture!</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>TYPES OF PORTRAITS</strong></p>\r\n<p>There are three kinds of people photographs that bring you in close: a head shot; a three-quarter portrait, wherein you include the upper portion of their chest and shoulders along with their head; and the environmental portrait, where you are in close so yet you&rsquo;ve included something of their surroundings to add some story to the picture about who they are, or where they live.</p>\r\n<p>To ease into photographing up-close, begin with an environmental portrait and then move in closer and closer, if they are comfortable. You can usually read their body language to tell you if it&rsquo;s still OK. This helps makes you more comfortable at the same time, and gives you an opportunity to check exposure, lighting, etc. on the first shot before you get in really close.</p>\r\n<p>Some people prefer to just get in close first, and it&rsquo;s not a bad idea if your subject is &lsquo;on the move&rsquo; and you might not get more than one minute for a photo. I try to assess each situation as I&rsquo;m approaching the person. A vendor is sitting and waiting for buyers, so I&rsquo;ll have a bit more time. But someone walking down the lane, en route to somewhere, may not give me more than a half-minute so I have to work quickly! This is where having the knowledge of how to work your camera&rsquo;s controls quickly to get the right exposure and focus without much fuss is essential. You will lose their interest if you are fussing around with how to get your camera set up and that will show in the picture.</p>\r\n<p>The Berber woman was at first unsure, but I told her she had a beautiful face. I meant it &ndash; uniquely interesting. That seemed to relax her a bit, and she allowed me to make this picture. Her eyes seemed to smile a bit through that weathered face. I moved around to position her against a more simple background that at least matched the colors of her clothing.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment2}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The beautiful young monk in Myanmar was willing to let me make pictures, and his parasol added a wonderful graphic element to make the composition strong. I got in close to fill the frame with the umbrella, placing him slightly off center for more visual interest.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment3}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The wonderful face of this Bhutanese man with his unique hat drew me in. I had to purchase a snack to get his permission, but it was worth it. The light falling on his face from his storefront window was lovely and separated him from the darker recesses of his tiny shop. The tilt of the hat gave a rather jaunty effect above his friendly face.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment4}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Thought not entirely an environment portrait, I just loved the combination of colors to support his very interesting face. He was 85 years old and proud of it. His clothing helps to tell a story about him.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The piece of meat hanging in the background tells the story of the meat vendor in this portrait. I loved his tattoos, and blue tank top against his warm-toned skin, but without that meat, you would know little about him.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment6}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Sometimes you end up with two subjects in your frame, as this mother and daughter sitting on their front doorstep in Guatemala. I composed to include some of the house to show where they lived, and I loved how the clothing on the clotheslines matched their blouses. I look for details like that to help create a stronger environmental portrait.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>This hat maker in Morocco was surrounded on one side by all the hats he made &ndash; he was very industrious and was making one when I stopped to ask if I could photograph him. The left side of the picture was the alley I had walked up, and was distracting, so I framed him tighter against that edge and let the hats fill the rest of the frame to tell the story about him. I am always looking for photos like this when I&rsquo;m walking about the streets of any village. They tell you more about the people than a simple headshot will.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Photographing in Morocco is not always so easy &ndash; but this chicken vendor was willing to show me his &lsquo;stock&rsquo;, so while he posed I zoomed back to include more of the environment of turkeys and chickens around him. I loved the rough texture on the walk &ndash; what a great background to simplify this picture. Tell people how much you like their products, even if you can&rsquo;t buy them. Proud vendors often make good pictures.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>We had made an appointment to come see this young Italian master violinist at work. But I treated it much like an environmental portrait, including his surroundings to tell the story of his trade. While not a true candid moment, and not a portrait, this type of picture still tells a great story.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PRACTICE YOUR TECHNIQUE</strong></p>\r\n<p>The more you practice, the better you&rsquo;ll get at making portraits, getting all the settings right at &lsquo;first go&rsquo; in order to be efficient so you don&rsquo;t lose your subject&rsquo;s attention or your subject entirely as they move on! To practice, start photographing strangers around your own hometown. Attend public festivals, or performances, and ask the performers if you can photograph them. They are used to being in the \"spotlight\" and this makes it easier for you to get used to approaching a stranger and asking permission. Another great place to practice is at a park where children are bound to be there with parents. Asking the proud parents\' permission often garners a &lsquo;yes&rsquo;. Now, if you can just get the child to agree!</p>\r\n<p>When you receive permission, don&rsquo;t just make one picture! It is risky &ndash; they can blink, look away the instant you press the button, or you, being a bit nervous, might cause camera shake. Take your time to make the best picture you can.</p>\r\n<p>Watch your background &ndash; for head-shoulder type portraits, I usually open my aperture to f5.6 or more to throw the background out of focus &ndash; and frame as tightly as possible to minimize distractions. For environmental portraits, I&rsquo;ll go the other direction, with a smaller aperture of f11 or more, so the background is in focus, or at least very distinguishable in the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tip:</strong> <em>The focal length you use when photographing people is an important consideration. Wide angles (20-28mm) are great for the environmental portrait, but they can cause unflattering distortion when getting in too close to your subject. Pay attention to how your subject looks in the frame, with wide-angles, and back off a bit if they are becoming too distorted. Then, switch to a normal focal length or a moderate telephoto of about 85-100mm to do the close-in portraits.</em></span><br /><br />Longer telephotos will optically compress the face, (180-300mm range), which sometimes can be flattering. But you\'ll want to get the tip of the nose and the eyes sharp and will have to choose a smaller aperture that gives you that, while still keeping the background out of focus to place attention on the person.&nbsp; Generally, 50-150mm is the most effective range for close-in portraits. This gives you the most pleasing compression of features, and allows you to choose an aperture that keeps the person in focus while minimizing any details in the background.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>USING INTERESTING LIGHT FOR PORTRAITS</strong></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not always possible to control the light when you are walking around the village or town, but I look for certain things that will help me make a better picture. In the mornings or afternoons, I walk the streets that have sunlight striking one side of the street&rsquo;s buildings, as this light reflects into the shaded side of the street and can create wonderful bounce light to work with for any type of photo, but especially for people.</p>\r\n<p>The light colored dirt outside a covered monastery doorway bounced enough light into this young monk&rsquo;s face to make it possible to photograph him, and it was beautiful light on a beautiful face for just a few moments before he lost interest in being photographed!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t to say that I will avoid other streets in total shade, but I love the bounce light when I can find it for portraits.</p>\r\n<p>The soft light of a cloudy day or shade can make photographing people much easier. If they are in sun, I will often ask them to either turn around so their face is shaded, or to move into the shade for a better picture. Learning the phrase &lsquo;it&rsquo;s better&rsquo; in the language goes a long way to communicating why you are positioning them. Gentle nudging can also work but check the culture for proper protocol. For example, women cannot touch monks in most Buddhist countries.</p>\r\n<p>This farmer loved his Brahma cow and naturally leaned on it when I went to make a picture. It was serendipitous that his shirt matched the background foliage, but I asked him to move there for a better background.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>In the case of the man sitting in his porch chair, it was the strong light that I loved &ndash; with his shadow stretching off to the right. It expressed of the strength of the Cuban sun, and the side light brought out the rougher texture of his face.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment14}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>MAKE UNUSUAL PORTRAITS</strong></p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s fine to make straightforward portraits of people and most often that is what you will do. But when you can, try to think creatively about alternate ways to make a picture. For example, this young Bhutanese nun had just opened the door to go to lessons, and I saw the soft screen and how it affected the overall image of her behind it. I quickly asked her permission to photograph her. I had time for only three pictures before she had to leave, but I loved how the screen gave a soft texture to the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>If you are still hesitant about approaching total strangers, try photographing people you interact with on a regular basis while you are traveling. People in service jobs, such as waiters, taxi drivers, shopkeepers - are all used to travelers. And while you are interacting with them for their services/products, you can also ask to make a picture of them. This works very well if you have paid them for their services, or tipped them, but it\'s not a requirement to getting a nice picture.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tip:</strong><em> Give yourself an assignment so you can say \"I\'m photographing village life in rural Italy,\" or \"I\'m working on a visual presentation for my camera club.\" For some reason, this gives us justification to ask people for permission - as if the simple reason of making photographs because we are so fascinated or interested isn\'t enough!</em></span></p>\r\n<p>Usually, the best light for people is soft, diffuse light, or reflected light, on their faces. Move them to lighting if possible, or just turn them so their face is more evenly lit in the shade. Find a better background if necessary. I know this isn\'t always possible, but it\'s worth a try. Also, if time permits, you can start with an image a little further away, to show them in their environment. This also acts as a warm-up for both you and your subject, and it gives you a chance to figure out what you want to do next. Then, move in closer, to capture a head and shoulder portrait.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s all quite easy to photograph people, once you get used to the idea of approaching strangers. I truly believe that \"genuineness\" comes across in your mannerisms, in your approach. My camera is a license for me to be curious, and I am curious about people as much as the scenery when I travel.</p>',17,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:50:25','2015-02-23 17:07:06'),(115,41,'Capturing Moments of Daily life, Festivals and Rituals',NULL,'<p>Nothing expresses a culture better than candid images of everyday life. No matter where I am, I love to walk around and photograph candid moments of people interacting with each other. When I travel, I rise early and take to the streets to see what I can find. I\'m always rewarded with photo opportunities. It might be a vendor setting up shop, a priest walking down a village lane on his way to vespers, or two people chatting on a street corner. As the town or city awakes, I find many opportunities for candid photographs of daily life!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Candid images are popular with many of us because it\'s the least intrusive method of photographing people. You haven&rsquo;t had to ask permission, and you make the photo and move on, with little interaction. You are often not in very close, although you could be. If you haven\'t done much candid photography in your travels, this lesson is a good opportunity to try it and see if you like it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">What makes a good candid moment? Two things are essential: <strong>1)</strong> a gesture, or some body language that tells the story of the moment; and <strong>2)</strong> the person or people should be unaware of your presence.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photojournalists practice this type of photography all the time. You can practice it too. All it takes is becoming really good at observing everything going on around you and watching people&rsquo;s gestures and body language. That, and developing a sixth sense to anticipate the moment, are all that you need. Developing the sense of what&rsquo;s to come isn&rsquo;t as hard as it sounds. Some human activities are similar around the world and if you start by just observing those, you\'ll develop your skills at anticipating the moments. <br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The activity at your local farmer\'s market is the same activity at a market in Holland or Egypt.

There&rsquo;s an expression of peacefulness on the baby&rsquo;s face that contrasts with the bustling market around him.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment3}<br /></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">In another market scene elsewhere, an old man carefully tucks in a rose to the bouquet as he prepares them for market. The light illuminated him in a way that drew my attention to his actions. </span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>GESTURE AND BODY LANGUAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Gesture is a pivotal element in a candid image because it provides the moment.</p>\r\n<p>It might be as simple as a wave of a hand, a smile, a foot lifted off the pavement, or an expression on someone\'s face. But these animations express a moment in time that you can capture, and they make the picture more expressive.</p>\r\n<p>The Cuban man smoking his morning cigar outside his home was a great photo opportunity. He was standing there enjoying his morning cigar, and I was working various compositions when the door opened and his wife peaked out to see whom he was talking to. She retreated soon after, but I managed to get a real moment and juxtaposition of the two of them.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Behind the scenes at a Bhutanese festival, we had great opportunities to watch them dress in their elaborate costumes for ritual dances. When the one guy stuck his finger firmly on the tied neck cord, I seized the moment. That single gesture makes the picture expressive.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment5}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Often people do repetitive actions. This Latin-American Indian woman was doing her ritualistic prayers, and swung the incense burn back and forth. All I had to do was get in the rhythm of her swing, and time it to get the can showing and the smoke billowing just right. I made many pictures trying to get the right timing on this moment.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment6}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Something about the body language on these two children was irresistible for me. They acted like adults in small bodies the way they sauntered along the cobblestone. It&rsquo;s a simple picture, but their gestures are strong.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment7}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The body language on this commuter in Venice told the story of soaking up the morning sun while riding to work past iconic buildings, that to him might have been just another building. By including the edge of the boat and some piece of architecture beyond that was recognizable, I could give this picture a sense of place while capturing the moment.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment8}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Often, the pictures are on the fringe of other activity. We were photographing fisherman demonstrating their technique in Myanmar, and while the group was working with two other men, these two were sitting on their boats and taking a break. It was a natural moment that is one of my favorite pictures from that morning.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment9}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Candid moments can be about juxtaposition, too. This man was whistling, and he pursed his lips like one of the caricature drawings. Even his profile reminded me of the style of his drawings and I grabbed the moment of the comical juxtaposition.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment10}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>You can make an otherwise static detail come to life with a suggested moment. These prayer wheels were a lovely detail image of the temple, but the picture was lacking something. When an old woman walked by and spun the wheels, it spun for a little while after she moved on, just enough for me to capture the invisible hand.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment11}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>When you travel, it\'s not always easy to blend in. I am blonde-haired and blue-eyed. I only \"fit in\" in Europe, Scandinavia, or the US. But I have found that in markets and festivals, the longer I stay in one place, the more invisible I become. Action returns to normal after the effect of the stranger wears off. That\'s when I can make my best images. This can work for you, too. We all become invisible after we stay in a place for any length of time, and that gives us an opportunity to be the proverbial &lsquo;fly on the wall&rsquo; and make some great candid moments. Other ways to blend in are to wear a local style hat, or scarf. Wearing safari clothing in the middle of France seems out of place and marks us as a tourist immediately, so anything you can do to dress like the locals gives you a better chance of blending in a bit more.</p>',17,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:50:45','2015-02-23 17:11:02'),(116,41,'Framing with a Sense of Design',NULL,'<p><strong>PHOTOGRAPHING WITH DESIGN</strong></p>\r\n<p>I love to include elements of design with my photographs of places I&rsquo;ve been. It&rsquo;s a signature style for me to include design elements when possible in making my compositions. You can incorporate lines, patterns, shapes and textures to your pictures, too, to add something extra to a photograph. All you have to do is begin looking for design and you&rsquo;ll find it! Often, elements of design show up in more intimate landscapes and in the detail images, but even a broad scene can contain visual design.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>SHAPES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Everything in a picture is a shape of some sort, and our job as photographers is to &lsquo;arrange&rsquo; the shapes to be a pleasing composition by how we frame and position ourselves to the scene before us. By its very nature, architecture contains angles and shadows that create great geometrical shapes, and often they are brought out by sunlight. This image from a small hotel in Mexico was so colorful, and the shelves that stepped up the side of the wall created great shapes and shadows in the strong morning sun. The stone figures created an additional layer of shapes to see as you moved along the shadow boxes of the wall.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Not every study in architecture requires full sun, however. The open shade of the cloudy day allowed me to capture the minute details of this ornately decorated temple in Thailand. The unique architecture expresses a sense of place at the same time being a visually pleasing detail image. I created a symmetrical composition to strengthen the impact of the repetitive shapes of the roofs.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>In Assisi, Italy, I was standing above a walkway and noticed this monk about to walk up the hill. The shape of the shadow against the shape of the sunlit part of the frame attracted me, and I knew that if I waited for him to walk into the lit area, I would also get his shadow shape. The image had little color so I knew it would be a great black and white.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment3}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Walking in Trinidad, Cuba, I spotted these bicycles against colorful walls from a distance, and as I got closer I noticed the puddle. That made me very happy! The scene was full of shapes created by the architecture and paint design, and the bicycles, and all of that repeated in the reflection just made the image even more graphic and gave it the impact I wanted.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The simple shape of the old car juxtaposed against the wall with a single window that just happened to match the car&rsquo;s color is what drew me to photograph this image. This sort of thing happens a lot in the old colonial towns of Cuba and it was something I began to look for &ndash; matching or complimentary colors of cars, bicycles, people against walls/windows. The rectangular shape of the window echoes the rounded-edge rectangular shape of the car.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The Buddha hand gesture is a recognized shape around the world, and this detail was a perfect picture to add to my narrative of my travels in Thailand. The texture of the hand from all the gold leaf that has been applied tells a story, too, about the many devotees that have offered up to Buddha some gold for receiving a blessing.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>The silhouette of the monk with billowing robes is a strong shape against the white wall, and the window detail above creates the juxtaposition of two shapes in this picture. The picture has two strong shapes, and the sidelight brought out the texture in this scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>PATTERNS</strong></p>\r\n<p>Patterns, when similarly shapes objects repeat in a scene, are a visually pleasing image for our eyes/brain. A pattern begins when you have at least five repetitions, but it&rsquo;s expressed more strongly if you have even more. Markets provide a great place to photograph for photographing pattern with all the produce or products for sale. This pile of colorful shoes in Morocco is fun pattern example. I framed tightly to fill the frame with just shoes to express the pile of them, and it gives you a hint of where you are in the world at the same time by the style of the shoes. When I can express a sense of place at the same time I&rsquo;m making a detail photograph, I&rsquo;m delighted!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>I liked the repetitive circles of the fish baskets I found at a small market in Thailand. The fish shapes repeat within each repeating circular basket, creating a strong pattern image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>TIP:</strong> <em>When photographing pattern, frame it tightly so that it expands beyond your frame to create more impact to the pattern; that suggests the pattern runs on forever and expands it in the mind&rsquo;s eye.</em></span></p>\r\n<p>You can use just hints of pattern in images and that can make your picture stronger. In the image of the monk holding a rice bowl, the one bowl and his arms embracing it are what I wanted, but I saw that if I positioned myself just right, I could get a hint of the line or monks behind him before they made the turn in the hallway. The subtle pattern that filled the background makes the picture visually better.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment10}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The knife against the colorful Moroccan blanket shows how you can break up a pattern with something, and the two elements become in contrast to each other, making the impact of the image stronger.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>The same is true in the fountain image; the tiles created repetitive circular shapes, along with the lion head spigot. But it needed something more for that picture to be interesting, and it was the running water that defined the fountain and broke up the pattern.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>LINES</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lines exist everywhere in our world, and you can use them to your advantage in making a photograph. They serve as a visual pathway that takes the eye through the frame, hopefully past interesting things that tell us something. Be also aware that lines are the strongest of the elements of visual design, and straight lines have a strong energy that moves the eye along them much faster than a meandering, lazy &lsquo;S&rsquo; curve will. Horizontal lines will be calmer than vertical lines in the energy they express in a composition. If you are photographing a scene with a strong horizontal line, try to keep it out of the middle of your frame &ndash; raising the camera higher or lower to move that line off the center axis so you don&rsquo;t divide the picture space in two horizontally. This is true for any line, vertical or even an oblique line. Be sure not to have your lines entering and leaving opposite corners, or you will divide your picture in half, weakening the composition.</p>\r\n<p>In Trinidad, Cuba, I used the central stone blocks of the cobblestone alley to serve as a visual path to take you past this blue wall and window, and the slight uphill provided a softer &lsquo;line&rsquo; along the edge of the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>The country road in Tuscany meandered through lush fields past the iconic cypress trees that grow in the Mediterranean region, thus giving a bit more sense of place to the image. The line of the undulating road is an inviting pathway to travel through the spring landscape. The warm afternoon light skimming across the surface of the landscape brought out the texture of the landscape, too.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment14}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Lines don&rsquo;t always have to be a continual line. The three stands of flowers in this simple Cuban storefront step you visually through the scene to the background electrical box on the wall behind. A still life of a sort, it still incorporates the concepts of design &ndash; in that each flower stand becomes an object that repeats enough to move you through the scene. So many stores in Cuba a like this &ndash; with little to sell, but they still open their shops up each day.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>DETAIL THAT TELL THE STORY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Many detail pictures can tell the story if you include enough information for the viewer. This fish seller in Trinidad, Cuba created a symmetrical composition when I asked him to stand holding his fish up for me to see. I liked the warm stucco wall behind him, and his simple clothing.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}</p>\r\n<p>The fabric and notions shop in Fes, Morocco was colorfully packed to the ceiling with things related to sewing. I loved the colorful squares that each shelf created as it made a pattern of the shop, and the old ladder helped to break up the pattern and give you something to land on visually, all while telling a story about the shop.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment17}</p>\r\n<p>The higher viewpoint of this musician playing his bongo drums was a way to eliminate a busy background and clear the cowbells a bit more to capture him playing. His shirt suggests you are somewhere in the tropics where this type of music is played, and the blurred action of his hands added energy to the detail image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment18}</p>\r\n<p>When you travel, remember to include the details that can tell more about a place in a simple, visually designed way.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>LESS IS MORE</strong></p>\r\n<p>We often think that by including more information we will make the picture stronger, when in fact, including less is often more! Rather than including a whole lot of the ornately decorated statue, I chose to frame the face and a bit of the torso against the simple roof tiles of the background temple.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment19}</p>\r\n<p>For all the wonderful scenic images you may make while traveling, you will find that capturing the details can also bring a sense of place to your viewer.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:51:05','2015-02-23 17:12:33'),(117,41,'Stunning Photos Whatever the Light',NULL,'<p><strong>MAKING THE MOST OF THE LIGHT</strong></p>\r\n<p>One of the biggest challenges we face as photographers is dealing with the light. It can&rsquo;t always be perfect, when we travel, and so it&rsquo;s a good idea to learn to use the light you have and try to make pictures that work in that light. In my workshops, I often hear people say they couldn&rsquo;t be there for sunrise so the light wasn&rsquo;t great when they did get there. But maybe what&rsquo;s needed is to rethink what your photograph will be in the light you have. If you are at the Taj Mahal at the &lsquo;wrong&rsquo; time of day, perhaps photographing details on the shady side of the mosque is the answer for getting a photograph that pleases you. If you can plan to be somewhere in the right light, you have the opportunity to make great pictures.</p>\r\n<p>Learn to &lsquo;read&rsquo; the light. When you arrive somewhere, look at the quality of the light &ndash; i.e whether it&rsquo;s specular light with strong shadows, or diffused light with soft shadows, or completely flat light with little shadow. Look at what the light is doing on the subject you are interested in photographing. Is the light the appropriate for your scene or subject? Typically, large landscapes or scenics that have quite a bit of sky don&rsquo;t work well in overcast skies, as the sky becomes too light and with little details. Of course, dramatic clouds can make that an exception and add mood to the scene. If you have an overcast sky, try to compose a picture with little or no sky to eliminate the problem of having an area of the frame that is too light. More intimate landscapes and details and portraits are great with an overcast sky situation, so look for those types of photographs on cloudy days. Or, if you have the time, come back to the scene you want in better light, or think of another position or viewpoint to use the light you have in that moment. There is usually more than one right answer for many subjects you&rsquo;ll photograph, if you just get a little creative and think about changing your position and your composition.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, you don&rsquo;t get the choice of the best light that you might want, but you can get lucky from time to time and have an image work out just fine. If you have interesting clouds to create dappled light, as I had here in the fields of Cuba in mid-morning, the contrast can work out just fine and the shadows will create dimension and separation of objects. I had to photograph when the farmer was there, so you work with what you have and hope the conditions are favorable.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment1}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>LOW-LIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Photographing during pre-dawn or dusk can yield fantastic photographs. I always try to look at the place I&rsquo;m visiting under dawn or dusk skies, as well as nighttime images, because they capture the mood and a different view of the place that most travelers see.</p>\r\n<p>When you want to photograph a big city skyline, try planning your photo session for twilight, just after sunset, on a weekday. The cleaning crews work after everyone has gone for the day, and more lights are on in the buildings, making them more illuminated at dusk. On the weekends many lights are off in office buildings to save energy. Skylines at twilight are best photographed about 15-30 minutes after the sun has set, when exposure value of the twilight sky is in balance with the exposure value of the window lights. It is also a great time to photograph village lanes, street corners, shopping streets, etc. where you can include the sky for a rich blue contrast to the warm street and shop lights. You will always have overexposure here and there in this type of photo, as the source of the lights will be too bright, but you aim for the best overall exposure for the rest of the scene while trying to minimize the space given to any area that is too bright.</p>\r\n<p>These same scenes can be captured in pre-dawn &lsquo;twilight&rsquo;, but in many places the light turn off just as the light is getting great, to my disappointment, and the office buildings are darker, too. I just prefer post-sunset twilight for that reason, but I still go out very early to capture what I can during the magic hour.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>TIP:</strong> <em>Light from most office buildings is fluorescent and yields a green color cast when your camera is set to daylight balance. Auto white-balance can help correct that, but it may also shift the color of the sky a bit, adding magenta to the picture to cancel the green in the lights.</em></span></p>\r\n<p>I always bring out my tripod for low-light photography as it yields better results. I use mirror lock-up and the self-timer or my remote release to trip the shutter to minimize camera shake. I turn OFF vibration reduction (VR), also known as image stabilization (IS), unless the manufacture has confirmed that keeping it on while on a tripod is OK. (This is true for some newer lenses/cameras now)</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong>Tip:</strong> <em>If you have to hand hold your camera in low light situations, put the camera on continuous frame mode. Then, turn ON image stabilization (also known as vibration reduction) if you have it, squeeze the shutter button gently and hold it down for two or three pictures. The frames in the middle will typically be the sharpest - unaffected by the initial pressing of the shutter or the final letting up of it. Another method is to use exposure bracketing, set to just 1/3-stop difference, and the 2-second self timer. Pressing the shutter button then activates the timer, releases the shutter and three pictures are made in a sequence that are very close in exposure, so you can select the sharpest of the three. A beanbag is great if you have railings or other supports over which to drape it.&nbsp; Leaning against lampposts, pillars, etc. can work but I often find they aren&rsquo;t where I want to position myself for the composition!</em></span></p>\r\n<p>Predawn in Tuscany meant getting up very early in May, but it was worth it. The valley had morning mist softly flowing through it, and the pink sky against the bluish land was so pretty. About 45 minutes before sunrise, you can find this sort of color balance if the atmospheric conditions are right. Mounted on my tripod, with the mirror locked up, I exposed for 6 seconds at f16.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment2}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Dusk along the Arno river in Florence, Italy is a beautiful thing to experience and photograph.

The small aperture gave me the starburst effect on the lights, and the long exposure smoothed out the water surface a little bit.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment3}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>I often choose a minimum aperture of f11-f22 to keep my depth of field good, but it&rsquo;s not always possible. The aerial view of Bangkok at dusk was a six-second exposure at just f6.3. A bust of wind now and then at the 64th floor caused me concern about camera shake, so I kept the exposure as short as possible by using a wider aperture. But being as far away as I was from the scene below me, I knew that it would still keep everything sharp at the 26mm focal length I used.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment4}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>When night is falling, that rich twilight blue of the sky is beautiful when set against buildings that are lit. The church in Antigua&rsquo;s square shows how you can balance the artificial lights against that twilight sky. The exposure was 20 seconds, to keep my ISO low and reduce the potential for digital noise. The rainy street added visual interest, picking up the warm glow of the incandescent lights of the church.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The central piazza in San Gimignano, Italy took on a more magical appearance at twilight, when the street lamps and the shop windows lit up against the deep blue sky. Exposed for 25 seconds, with an f16 aperture, I captured the mood of the nighttime scene. People that moved through the scene quickly dissappeared, making it look like no one was out that night.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment6}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Contrast can be a useful thing, especially in black-and-white photography. But even in color, you can use the contrast to your advantage. Using the backlight coming in the doorway of the tobacco barn, I composed this silhouette of the farmer while he smoked his cigar. There were others photographing him straight on, but I liked this alternative view of the moment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>I also used the high contrast situation on Inle Lake in Burma to my advantage. Underexposing a bit, I created an almost moonlit affect of this fisherman with his old nets.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Likewise, the shadow of a passing woman against the red wall offset the old car and created a stronger picture. Without her the space would be empty and the composition off balance. Looking for and photographing shadows is a great way to use the sunlight you have in a creative way.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment9}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Another type of light that I love to use is bounce light. It&rsquo;s typically the light that is reflecting off some sunlit wall or surface that lands on something opposite it, such as this Cuban fruit seller. The warm glowing light was from the morning light striking the opposite walls that had soft yellow paint, and it struck his body with beautiful warm light, and filled in the shadows of his shop. This is beautiful light to work with for portraits but it also work really well for any travel scene or detail.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment10}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>The young Buddhist monks were illuminated by one large window to the left. Indirect light like this can be wonderful for photographing people indoors.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment11}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS</strong></p>\r\n<p>Fog, snow, rain, and storm light can create wonderful atmospheric results and I love to be out in it when there&rsquo;s weather happening.</p>\r\n<p>On morning along the Malec&oacute;n in Havana, Cuba, the waves were crashing against the sea wall and the sun was just rising. It struck the splash of the wave in that instant and it was amazing against the stormy gray sky behind. It was luck that the wave happened to explode just as the sun broke through some clouds, but you&rsquo;ll never get lucky if you don&rsquo;t go out during stormy conditions.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>The drama of a storm displayed itself over the town, and I just happened to be up in a tower for an elevated viewpoint. The rain curtain and the billowing grey clouds added drama and interest to the scene.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment13}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>Fog is one of those atmospheric conditions that has a magical quality to it. It can be light and ethereal, or dark and somber in effect. This one morning in Italy the fog was pouring over the crest of the hill, and the sun broke through to illuminate it from within, adding a warm glow to the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment14}</p>\r\n<p>On another morning, in a nearby location, we had fog again, but no sunlight and the effect is totally different, although still wonderful.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment15}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>INTERIOR PHOTOGRAPHY</strong></p>\r\n<p>For all interiors, you can choose to filter the color of the light by changing your white balance, but I often prefer the mixed colors that I get with daylight white balance, as it adds interest. It all depends on the scene. For interiors you typically must have a tripod, but when on the go I have sometimes found I&rsquo;m without mine when I duck into a church or other building while walking about in the middle of the day, so I use the methods above to try and stabilize and push the ISO high to get the photo. You will always have overexposed highlights with this type of picture as the source of the light will be too bright, so you just want to work with the best overall exposure possible to get the details in the shadows and such to show.</p>\r\n<p>For this image of the master violinmaker, I knew that the lightbulb would overexpose, but the light from it illuminated him and the cello panel he was working on, and that was most important. I pushed my ISO to 1000 and exposed at f4 for 1/80 sec, allowing his hand to blur to show the action of planing while keeping the rest sharp.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment16}</span></span></p>',16,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-07 15:51:22','2015-02-23 17:16:07'),(118,41,'Travel Photos that Speak Your Voice',NULL,'<p>You&rsquo;ve reached the last class of the course, and throughout the lessons you have received guidelines and tips to make better photographs of your travels, in a more documentary, straightforward way. But each of us has our own personal vision, or viewpoint, on the places we visit, and that vision should also be applied when making your pictures. <br /><br />This lesson will be short, because in the interest of personal vision, it&rsquo;s all about you and how you interpret your world! But I have included examples of how I have seen things that are beyond the documentary image to give you ideas and share my own vision. <br /><br />I encourage you to play a bit, to experiment with different shutter speeds, to find a unique point of view, and to push yourself to see in the most creative way you can while making the pictures. I also encourage you to apply your personal vision to the images afterwards, in post-processing. <br /><br />You are the artist, the one capturing the moment, interpreting the scene before you, and you can do what you wish to the photographs for the final results. <br /><br />Some of you might be in photography clubs or societies with competitions, and the rules for travel photography are often strict in saying that the picture must accurately represent what you saw &ndash; in the photojournalistic tradition. You can work within those guidelines to make the most realistic capture of the scene, while still providing creative viewpoints and gesture. But I like to go beyond those &lsquo;rules&rsquo; to express my feelings or my interpretations of a place, too, so I often have two versions of a scene &ndash; one that is most realistic with no effects, and one that has an &lsquo;effect&rsquo; &ndash; such as sepia or other monochromatic toning, or a touch of texture added, to bring the image out in a more artistic way. The choice is yours, but have some fun with your photography and experiment!<br /><br />This unusual viewpoint of a fisherman breaks the &lsquo;rules&rsquo; but makes the picture more universal and more dynamic. We don&rsquo;t really need to see the whole man &ndash; and in fact if we did, we often go to the person&rsquo;s face, so here, it&rsquo;s about fishing on the breakfront with a touch of the city beyond, and just waiting for a moment of a wave to splash to add some <span style=\"color: #000000;\">&lsquo;moment&rsquo; to the scene.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment1}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>I love capturing motion in my images &ndash; the blur of hands playing the bongo drums tells the story of tropical music being played. This gives energy to the picture, makes it feel alive.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br /><br />In the image of the Moroccan women speeding by on her scooter, there is still a sense of place because of her clothing, and the surroundings, which tells a story about women becoming more modern and independent in Morocco, while adding interpretive expression to the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br /><br />Reflections are such fun to work with when photographing. While walking through an Irish town, I spotted the performers through the window, and loved the abstract reflection at dusk with the warm lights of the interior of the pub. I positioned myself to get the violinist in a clear enough area so the eye had something to move to as it went through the layers of reflection.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}<br /><br />I used the idea of reflection in this interior in Morocco, to both show the architecture and the furniture to give a sense of place to the detail. The scene has depth by use of the mirror.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment5}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>When walking by an old car, I saw people reflected in the window and liked the juxtaposition of the two, so I waited for someone wearing something red to walk by, to pick up the matching color.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<br /><br />When I spotted this woman watching activity outside her lace-covered doorway, I was so excited! I loved how she was partially obscured by the lace, yet still visible, lending a bit of mystery to the image. It just added a more personal touch to the photograph, even though it&rsquo;s harder to tell much about the place. Sometimes you just need to make pictures because you like them without concern about whether they&rsquo;ll tell a particular story.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment7}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m always looking for details that tell a story, and while maybe not as obvious as the big picture &lsquo;story&rsquo;, they really add a lot to a slide show or book of your travels. This monk in a festival had new shoes &ndash; All-Stars sneakers! I loved the juxtaposition of them against his traditional robes.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}<br /><br />I love architectural details because of the design elements that you find in them. I still try to suggest a sense of place when possible, with my detail images, although it&rsquo;s not always possible, or obvious! In a restaurant atop the Atlas mountains of Morocco, I used the stairs and the window details to frame a graphic image that simply pleased me, regardless of whether it had &lsquo;value&rsquo; for my story on Morocco.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment9}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>I love a sepia look, but in this image I also added a dreamy soft glow to the image in post-processing, because Venice is romantic, nostalgic, and I wanted to express that. It still reads as a picture from Venice because of the iconic architecture and gondola, but with a personal vision.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}<br /><br />I applied a similar look to the accordion player in Italy. Tuscany also has that romantic, nostalgic feel, and it just seemed to fit my interpretation of the moment. This man was playing during a festival that celebrated the &lsquo;old memories&rsquo;!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}<br /><br />The image of the nun was fine in color, with her habit being blue and the walls being white with a terracotta band at the bottom, but to bring out the mood of the light more, I chose to convert this to a toned black and white.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment12}</span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">You have come to the close of this course in travel photography, and you have gained many insights into how you can make your travel pictures more creative and stronger in telling the story of your travels.

Return engagement.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I want to begin by re-emphasizing that you need not trot the globe and you need not put yourself in perilous situations to be a competent and successful documentary photographer. What you do need, though, is to develop an insatiable curiosity about the world around you and a desire to tell the story to the broadest audience possible.</p>\r\n<p>Can\'t tell you exactly why, but I\'ve always been extremely interested in the workings of human cultures and societies. In high school, I excelled in the social sciences and went on to study anthropology - the study of humankind in the most general sense - at university. Probably like many of you, I was brought up on the National Geographic Magazine, pouring over every picture in detail and wanting to be one day, too, in the position to make such stunning and fascinating images.</p>\r\n<p>So, since my high school days, I have been fiddling around with cameras and darkrooms and such. Photography and anthropological studies went hand-in-hand throughout my days of formal education. I took a photo course here and there, but for the most part, I taught myself just how a photo story should unfurl and how to do justice to the subject and to myself as \"visual\" storyteller, in the process.</p>\r\n<p>Now to streamline this anecdotal account here just a bit, I\'ll jump to 1997. It was in that year that I first walked into an editor\'s office and asked to be given a chance at a photo-story - my very first! It was in Denver, Colorado, USA and the magazine\'s name at the time was, Rocky Mountain Sports and Fitness. This start-up publication was a monthly featuring color photos, albeit not printed on glossy paper. Being a regional mag that fit the kinds of stories I was most interested in (Keep in mind that photographers must always be thinking \"markets\"), I decided to give it a go. I made an appointment with the editor (never show up unannounced) and arrived equipped with a story idea I thought he might just be interested in. Although I carried the requisite \"book,\" or collection of enlargements to showcase the breadth and scope of my work, it was my idea that closed the deal for a 2500-word story, including the cover shot and about 12 inside images. Outwardbound Training for Corporate Executives was my topic. In about thirty minutes, I convinced the editor that teaching outdoor skills such as rock-climbing and orienteering could lead to greater productivity and cooperation among boardroom executives. He found the idea a good one and assigned me - first-time recipient of a photo assignment - to cover the story for his magazine.</p>\r\n<p>\"Oh wait! I haven\'t taken a look at your work yet,\" he called out as I walked from his office. \"Ah - never mind, just go for it,\" he finished. Granted, not many an editor these days is going to pave the way so easily, but my fortuitous example does show that \"breaks\" do happen and they can happen to you, too. You just need to be prepared for them - \"skill-wise\" and \"business-wise\" - when they do.</p>\r\n<p>So, where to start with all of this? The short answer is to begin just where you are - geographically speaking. Take a walk around your block, neighbourhood, town or city. What kinds of things interest you visually here? What types of situations might lend themselves to more in-depth visual exploration?</p>\r\n<p><strong>The important things to ask yourself when considering a photo-story topic include:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp; Can the story be told visually? This question, of course, is of paramount importance. If the story can be defined only in words, then it definitely won\'t work for you. I\'ll give you an example. A couple of years ago, I set out to tell the story of how the lives of Indian \"untouchables\" - converted to Buddhism one year before - had changed. About all I could find in any of the homes I visited, was a small Buddhist shrine in the corner of a room, otherwise these people and their surroundings looked exactly the same. I eventually had to abandon the story from a photojournalist\'s perspective, on these grounds of no visible content.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp; Does the subject have broad appeal? That is, would it be of interest to an audience larger than me or my immediate family? Could others become interested in what I have visually presented?</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp; Will I be able to reveal more than just the \"tip of the iceberg?\" What I mean by this is, will I be able to investigate the story to the extent that deeper levels of meaning will become apparent in my picture coverage? For example, you\'ve decided to visually explore the life of a taxi driver. Great theme, in fact, but to do a complete story - kind of a \"24 hours in the life of\" type of coverage - you\'re going to have to be able to follow him or her around throughout their day - interacting with family at breakfast to hanging up the cap at day\'s end. A photojournalist needs to \"dive below the surface\" to reveal what lies beneath that proverbial \"tip of the iceberg.\" Only in this way can an honest <strong>and complete photo-documentary work be produced - a rich visual story told.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong>&nbsp; Can the situation be revisited? More times than not, you\'ll find that there are missing pieces or loose ends to your stories that need clarified, included or re-examined. This is the \"journalistic\" aspect of the work you\'re producing - the who, what, when, where, why and how that fleshes-out the story. Facts are presented as you find them and interpreted according to who you are as a photographer.</p>\r\n<p>Recently, during time at home between assignments, I followed such a process. I explored the nature of an alternative and experimental school near where I live and made visual \"notes\" of its workings. The curriculum here included among other offerings, organic gardening, training in classical music, co-educational cooking and woodworking courses, as well as progressive classes in math and science.</p>\r\n<p>Using my camera as a sketchpad, I recorded moments and situations (examples below) that might guide me to the story (stories) and that could result from this exercise. For instance, I might focus on a single teacher going through his or her day at the school. I could look at gender roles and how they are different in this school - how women cross traditional male-female role boundaries, or how young men learn to \"home-make\" for themselves. The possibilities are not endless, but there are certainly stories here worth telling visually!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One last thing before I turn it over to you. That is, in order to clarify a potential story for yourself and others (i.e. editors), it\'s customary to formulate what you are proposing to do in a story-line \"synopsis.\" This is not a full-blown \"query\", which we\'ll get to later in the course, but a short (200 words maximum), succinctly written paragraph or two about the photo-story / feature-story you intend to produce. Below is one such synopsis - that relating to a completely different story I proposed to do in Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Beauty Central - Kabul</strong></em></p>\r\n<p><em>It began with ten cosmetic professionals travelling from New York to Kabul, Afghanistan in the wake of Taliban prohibition on beauty salons. The team\'s goal was to teach Afghan women the skills to perform Western-style beauty makeovers in a land where women faced the public in a long blue sack - the burkha. Kabul Beauty School\'s In a land where job opportunities for women are almost non-existent and women remain behind closed doors most of their lives, the step to become a western-trained beautician has brought empowerment and provided needed avenues of social and psychological release. And there\'s the money, too. Trained beauticians can take home pay ten times that of a female teacher or office worker receiving $30 - $40 per month. The Oasis Salon is the culmination of this venture, providing work opportunities for new graduates and a place to remain feminine for Americans and Europeans based in the capital city. This three-month training program has been a huge success.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Total word count: 168 with title.</strong></em></p>',7,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-19 16:52:28','2015-05-21 12:44:17'),(120,42,'Shooting in \"Other Cultures\" / Photographing in Personal Space',NULL,'<p><strong>Take a lesson from Hollywood. Parallels with the written word. Shooting from every which-way and down.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you\'re a watcher of television and movies, you already have a working knowledge of how a photo-story is put together. Don\'t worry if you can\'t sit down and outline that knowledge, most of it probably lies in your subconscious.</p>\r\n<p>Our job in this lesson is to delineate the kinds of shots you need to be looking for and making in order to move your picture story efficiently and effectively on its way toward an effective conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s begin with what I mean by, \"grammar\" in visual form. Sorry if the term itself is a turn-off. When I think back to school days there might be a slight bitter taste in mouth, too. I\'ll do my best to put a fresh \"spin\" on the concept. Start by thinking of images as elements in a sentence. Sentences, of course, have a subject, verb, direct and indirect objects, adjectives, etc. Picture stories and shorter photo-essays have these, as well. The grammatical counterparts here are: wide-angle (over-view / scene-setting) shots, middle-distance shots, close-up (detail / \"point\") shots and \"point-of-view\" images. The latter are a little harder to come by, but not impossible to capture. Think of them as \"icing on the cake.\" We\'ll talk more about this shortly.</p>\r\n<p>Now, think for a moment about how a movie unfolds. All the shots that I\'ve just described occur during the running of a Hollywood flick, or any other type of movie for that matter. The scene is set - perhaps a village square, shot from above during an annual festival. From here, the camera might then shift to a table set up where fashionably-dressed guests raise their glasses in toast to the occasion. Suddenly, one of the women at the table faints and slips to the ground. The camera zooms in on her hand still clutching a champagne glass. Next the camera pulls back to reveal a curious crowd encircling the scene, and so on. This same or similar orchestration of images is what can be found in every effectively told photo-story, too.</p>\r\n<p>A written story follows this same basic formula, whether it\'s a short-story or a full-blown novel. Take a look! There is also variety (if it\'s well written) in any piece of writing. This can be found in the form of word order expressed in sentences. Furthermore, sentences themselves vary in terms of paragraph length, etc. Visual stories are the same way. The goal is to hold the viewer\'s interest (or sell magazines, from the editor\'s point of view), whilst getting your message across with interest.</p>\r\n<p>The visual aspect of story-telling, however, adds another layer to this process. That means variety in terms of horizontal shots (landscape format) and verticals (portrait format), as well as differences in color, if color is what you\'re working in. As a photojournalist - a visual story-teller - you should shoot for an aesthetic and effective combination of all of these elements.</p>\r\n<p>Coverage of movie billboard painters in Delhi, India, included the first three photographs below. I became interested in this story when I\'d heard that the long-standing tradition of painting Bollywood\'s film advertisements by hand was becoming a dying art. When I investigated, I found only two remaining studios and decided that coverage was in order. These three images were all made at the same location. The studio employed seven persons, including assistants, apprentices and two master painters who, themselves, began as young boys at the bottom of this workshop hierarchy.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The neighborhood shot at the top conveys the level of activity I encountered at this studio and the context in which it is found. For me, this wide-angle view of things would do well as a scene-setter, because it conveys the \"chaotic\" (at least to western eyes) and social intimacy that is India and Indian society.</p>\r\n<p>A middle-distance shot, made with a 50mm lens, is represented in the second of these images.&nbsp; Its purpose is to draw the viewer closer to the action and further into the story. In this instance, a master painter is shown working on one of his canvases. As an aside, it\'s interesting to note that these works are not unique pieces. The studio will turn out one after the other - perhaps up to a dozen - in the exact same style - right to the last detail. The canvases, or in some cases plastic banners, are then hung up to dry, as seen in the first picture.&nbsp; Once dry - a matter of hours in the hot Indian sun - the works are rolled and placed on an overnight train to reach their destinations by morning. What I played on visually in this second photograph are the eyes appearing throughout the composition - repetition of form to lend strength to my interpretation of what was taking place.</p>\r\n<p>Last of the photos above is a close-up, detail or so-called, \"point\" shot. Such perspectives focus the viewer\'s attention and lend immediacy to the story. In this particular example, a painter takes a break next to a pile of movie studio advertisements, distributed by the production companies and used by billboard painters to guide their work. I like the way the figure on the page is \"looking\" up toward the artist, as if to be asking - \"What\'s next?\" - and that is why I chose to include it in my coverage.</p>\r\n<p>You might be curious as to where I got the idea for this story in the first place. The chain of events went like this. I had a free day in New Delhi following an assignment in Rajasthan, in the western part of the subcontinent. For the next two days, I would be in the city and searched for something to work on. Just walking around the city center, I noticed large color ads for movies on walls nearly everywhere. By chance I happened upon a young, local tour guide in search of work. I asked him what he knew of the billboard situation and he told me the story and added that one of the two remaining studios was located in his neighborhood - just \"right place at the right time\" kind of luck! I hired the chap and the next day we visited and photographed both of the remaining studios to make pictures. Photography can be very serendipitous; you just have to been open to things happening and be prepared when they do!</p>\r\n<p>Another example of the types of shots it takes to build a good photo-story is the one below. The following three images were made in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, where I was investigating primitive brick factories and how they affected peoples\' lives (mostly poor migrant workers from India) and the environment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The first of this series shows an overview of the situation, with the firing-kiln in the background. In the foreground of this photograph are laborers digging clay and forming raw bricks to be baked. The process is a hard one physically and the air pollution the industry produces, affects everyone who lives in this bowl-shaped valley.</p>\r\n<p>A \"middle-distance\" shot portrayed in the next, shows fired bricks being removed from the kiln. It takes 48 hours to completely bake the bricks to usable form. From this shot, the viewer gets an idea of the dust and heat that workers must endure for a very low daily payment.</p>\r\n<p>The final image in this series is a close-up portrait view of the brick-workers themselves.&nbsp; I wanted here to show both how young many of these laborers are and give the viewer a sense of the lung-congesting air they must breathe all day long.

What places the very strongest images - the most compelling photographs, shoulders above the rest?</p>\r\n<p>First thing to keep firmly in mind, is that there is no magic attached to becoming a good photographer.&nbsp; Most anyone can learn to use a camera and there are no \"Moments of Divine Revelation\" involved in any of it.&nbsp; Toddling over one\'s father\'s camera at the delicate age of six months and clicking a perfectly composed snap of the family dog, says nothing about who will be the next photographic great.&nbsp; Making compelling photographs comes from developing a sound foundation of camera skills and acquiring the knowledge of what works within the photographic frame and what does not.&nbsp; Beyond this lies the development of one\'s own vision - a personal and creative way of seeing and interpreting the world.&nbsp; This can only come from practice, experience and the supportive guidance of a knowledgeable mentor who has successfully traveled the photographic path, before you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>So here\'s what you need to know to start your journey:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>A photograph consists of two basic elements - foreground and background.&nbsp; </strong>\"Elementary,\" you say.&nbsp; Well listen, they don\'t just have to be there, they must work together, as well.&nbsp; What lies within the frame - what you see through your viewfinder - must add to a visual \"whole.\"&nbsp; Background must support in some way (can even be psychological) the subject of your composition and vise versa.&nbsp; If some element - even if it\'s on the very edge of your frame - doesn\'t fulfill its role in this respect, you need to find a way to get it out.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Get close and fill the frame.</strong>&nbsp; Those first-time snap-shots that placed uncle Jeff as a small element in the middle of a vast frame just don\'t cut it when it comes down to judging compelling photography.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In the photograph below, shot at a brick factory in Nepal, I stood atop the mass of just-fired bricks to capture the action of workers involved in clearing the kiln.&nbsp; My subject is the man piling bricks atop his head, dust filtering into the air, signs of struggle on his face.&nbsp; The background?&nbsp; It\'s just what this image is about - nothing more, nothing less - <em>bricks and human toil</em>.&nbsp; Subject and background are composed to support one another.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Great Light:</strong> You probably already know that early morning sun and that late in the day make for the most aesthetic and powerful images.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I worked early in the morning for the shot above - 7 a.m. I think it was in the Kathmandu Valley.&nbsp; The air was clear and crisp.&nbsp; I remember the morning very well - the light, the sounds - the smells of smoke still filtering from the dying kiln fires.&nbsp; Oh! And two other important characteristics of this photo and all strong images include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Great Color:</strong> If you\'re working in color, limit the number and hues you\'re working with.&nbsp; \"Few\" and \"related\" are the keywords here.&nbsp; Keep the color contents of your image simple.&nbsp; No more than four closely-related colors make for the strongest photographs.&nbsp; If black and white is your choice, strive for a full range of tones, from pure white to stark black and as many grays as you can manage, in between.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Interesting Composition:</strong> Move uncle Jeff away from the center of frame unless he\'s sitting cross-legged and meditating.&nbsp; Center-frame brings \"tranquility\" and a static feel to your photo.&nbsp; For a touch of dynamism, place Jeff closer to one of the four corners of your viewfinder.&nbsp; \"Rule-of-Thirds\" is the guideline to follow, in most cases.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I went the \"Rule-of-Thirds\" route in my brick factory photo, placing the subject (worker with bricks on head) near the lower left corner of the frame, with co-workers and \"work-to-be-done\" surrounding him, throughout the entire frame.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sense of Moment:</strong>&nbsp; <em>Icing on the photographic cake</em> - capturing an action, nuance - something happening \"beyond the ordinary\" in your photograph, this is what \"<em>Moment</em>\" is about.&nbsp; You want to stir emotion in your viewers.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I\'ve got two examples of capturing the <em>Moment</em> for you, below - one subtle, the second more dramatic.&nbsp; Both fill the bill of adding something \"noticeably other\" to the composition.&nbsp; The first photo below comes from Montalcino (Tuscany), Italy.&nbsp; It was made during lunch hours when streets of this sleepy hill-top village were all but empty - except for a lone figure of a Capuchin monk, making his way up a cobble-stone street.&nbsp; I stopped, set my camera\'s exposure, knew I wanted the old door on the left of the frame to \"balance\" the approaching figure, which I would position on the right side of my photo.&nbsp; When the monk approached a position that felt intuitively \"right,\" I made my photo.&nbsp; Ok, so what about the \"sense of moment\" bit?&nbsp; Subtle it may be, but that up-turned foot protruding from the monk\'s robes - propelling him forward up the long incline of a ancient, narrow street, is the element that brings dynamic to this picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The next example is more \"in your face.\"&nbsp; This image was made recently during a political rally in Istanbul, Turkey.&nbsp; Long lens from the sidelines?&nbsp; Nope!&nbsp; I moved in front of the gathered crowd of onlookers with a wide-angle lens to frame this young social crusader and capture \"the moment\" of youthful energy this man expressed.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br /><br />rishi</p>',10,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-20 14:48:42','2015-02-23 11:00:15'),(122,42,'Editing the Take - Telling the Story',NULL,'<p><strong>Opting for color (tone in B&amp;W) and design. Establishing a visual narrative.</strong></p>\r\n<p>In addition to the assignment photography I do, I conduct on-location photo workshops in northern India and Ladakh. In each of these, I ask students to compile a portfolio of their best work and to produce - like all of your in this course - a story they are most interested in - photographed in the area.</p>\r\n<p>Up unto this point, however, workshop participants and I have spent long evenings together going through each day\'s \"take\" - discussing what worked, what didn\'t and pinpointing why. Pretty much the same as we\'re doing here!</p>\r\n<p>Near the end of these intensive 10-day workshops, each participant has a pile of \"selects\" set aside - easily 50 or 60 of them. Now comes the tough part, to trim this collection down to a solid 12-image story. This is where the editorial process begins. But before jumping into the deep end of this, let\'s talk just a bit about what really constitutes a photo-story? To help answer this question, we\'ll draw from the \"visual grammar\" discussion presented in Lesson 3. That is, we can again consider analogies that relate photo-stories to those that rely on words to deliver their communication.</p>\r\n<p>For instance, both genres contain a distinct beginning, middle and end. Both attempt to grab viewer / reader attention and hold it with a dramatic start. In the case of a photo-story, this latter action is accomplished through visual impact - color, composition and a strong sense of moment.</p>\r\n<p>The first picture (below) in the following story about military emergency-room medical care, exemplifies this concept. Here on the flight-line at Kandahar Military Air Field in southern Afghanistan, a team of paramedics dashes toward an in-coming Medevac helicopter. Diagonal lines about the frame (including that \"drawn\" by the team\'s direction of movement) add visual tension and energy to this composition. \"Action\" body language and the sideways glance of the soldier emerging from the lower right corner of the frame, brings a \"sense of moment\" to the photograph. Hard shadows add drama and the whirl of the Blackhawk helicopter\'s tail rotor sparks an element of \"urgency\" in the eyes of the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second image of this story series maintains this tension, as a battlefield-wounded soldier is brought into the ER for immediate treatment. The third photo made from a middle-distance follows in this short account. In it, a nurse checks the patient\'s urine sample for signs of internal bleeding, before he is prepared for surgery, captured in the fourth photograph, as the mid-point of this medical drama.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With the fifth photograph, this short photo-story begins its resolve. Here, a detail close-up showing the small-caliber bullet that military surgeons removed from the soldier\'s abdomen becomes the layout\'s focus. The last image of this layout brings this coverage to a close through its depiction of members of the surgical team, relaxing briefly with a cup of coffee.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, this is the basic structure of a photo-story, but editorial details bring more. Like the author of sentences and paragraphs in a written story, the visual story-teller must craft his or her piece in a way that\'s both visually appealing and informative - a creative blend of content and style. Sentence length, vocabulary and grammatical elements do it for the word-smith. Photojournalists achieve a similar effect with picture format (horizontals and verticals), overview shots, close-ups, middle-distance images - all tied together by a thread of color or tonal harmony that runs from one picture to the next to create a visual \"wholeness\" for the viewer. And, if a sentence or paragraph doesn\'t move the story along for the writer, it\'s left out completely. The same applies for the photojournalist. If an image doesn\'t bring the viewer to the next step - doesn\'t offer a visual transition, then it\'s scratched from the layout. Is there any image in the emergency room layout presented here that falls into this category? Arguably not - for in a photo-essay of such length, that photograph would stand out like a sore thumb. And in today\'s editorial world of tighter budgets and greater competition for publishing space, there\'s no room for visual redundancy and inefficient, ineffective photo coverage.</p>\r\n<p>A similar and frequent editorial task of the visual story-teller is to choose between more than one photo taken of the same scene or situation. Which looks better? Which communicates more effectively? Again - striving for the best combination of aesthetic and just what the image provides in terms of information, this is the goal to be reached.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-21 11:54:19','2015-03-14 15:21:56'),(123,42,'Captioning in the Digital Age',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Getting the facts straight. International publishing standards. \"Key Words\" that bring results.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>A number of years ago, I photographed demonstrators in Beirut, Lebanon rallying against Syrian-influenced politics in their country. It was during this coverage that I experienced the complete \"digital workflow\" for the first time ever. This I thoroughly enjoyed! It afforded me the chance to see just how fast the process of filing my photos and \"making deadline\" can be.</p>\r\n<p>As I sat in the passenger seat of the car my \"fixer\" (a local who serves as guide, interpreter and all-round \"fix it\" person) drove, I dialed through my day\'s take of photos on the back of my camera\'s monitor. I immediately erased those that, for technical or compositional reasons, had no chance of seeing print. At the end of this exercise, I had reduced my selection down to about a hundred photos that would receive a final editing before they would be \"toned\" (i.e. contrast, color balance, sharpness fine-tuned) in Photo Shop, captioned and filed to my editor in Paris.</p>\r\n<p>Ugh! Did I say caption? Bits, bytes, pixels and such weren\'t going to help me much here. I still had to wade through it all, same as I did in my analog days. Well, fortunately the situation wasn\'t as laborious as I\'m making it out to be. With sophisticated software on the market these days, captioning - at least \"mechanically\" - can be taken care of quite quickly.</p>\r\n<p>I filed my day\'s work that evening and on time. But, despite all the wizardry of technology, it still comes down to the photographer who must supply the details - the \"who?\", \"what?\", \"when?\", \"where?\", \"why\" (and sometimes \"how?\") - that journalists are known for. It\'s certainly true that one of the most important - and difficult - tasks a visual storyteller must attend to is to place context and relevant facts to every photograph he or she places on the editor\'s desk (or instructor, in the present case) and then saves to a personal archive. This is where the caption comes in. And when a caption is properly written, it adds context, perspective and relevance to the work of the photojournalist and documentary photographer. Get this information wrong, and it doesn\'t matter how well the image is composed or how emotional the subject is. For that matter, it\'s not all that important either just how much impact the picture has. If the caption is incorrect or nonexistent, the \"journalism\" part of \"photo-journalism\" or photo-document stands unfinished and not fully communicative.</p>\r\n<p>Now - here\'s the good news. You don\'t have to be a writer to do great captions. In fact, you SHOULDN\'T try to be a writer. \"Just the facts ma\'am,\" as an old U.S. television detective series used to put it, is all you need to keep in mind to turn out a well-formulated caption. So, these are easy, but every organization has their own slightly different style of how captions should be done. The basics, however, remain the same. Just be simple, straight-forward, concise and factual. Forget you even know what an adjective is, for the time being. So, let\'s take a couple of examples and run them through the journalist\'s checklist.</p>\r\n<p>The first photograph below is of Dr. Masooda Jalal, the country of Afghanistan\'s first-ever female presidential candidate. She wasn\'t a successful candidate in the last democratic election (Hamid Karsai, of course, became that country\'s elected president and was later re-elected), but she remains a recognized and significant public figure in Afghanistan today. Therefore, any caption attached to her image must accurately be identified by name - correct spelling and all!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In contrast, the Afghan villager depicted in the next photo requires no such definite identification. He is photographed here paying close attention to a meeting of neighbors and U.S. Army soldiers, taking place just outside his window. He doesn\'t play a primary role in the photo-story in which he appears, he\'s simply an attentive eavesdropper - \"connective tissue\" - that moves the story along. For this reason, and because it\'s not at all necessary that the viewer of this picture knows this man\'s name, he is left an anonymous persona.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The aim of caption-writing is comprehensiveness and efficiency. Space for a caption is a wonderful opportunity to add flesh to an image. And, the best time to jot down the detail you\'ll need is not when you reach home or your hotel. Rather, it\'s just after you\'ve made the picture. Gather the relevant data, and do it on the spot, if possible. This way, you\'ll be sure not to get it wrong or leave something out. Check and double-check the information you\'ve received. If it isn\'t correct, you\'ve got a second chance to make it so. Carry a small notebook and pen for the task and give them a regular and readily accessible place in your camera bag.</p>\r\n<p>Now, let\'s put a piece of modern image software to work. There are two that I use regularly - the IIPTC application supplied with Photo Shop by Adobe and that of Photo Mechanic, on offer from Camera Bits. Both are easy to use, but for on the go, my choice is the latter because of its batch captioning capabilities. That is, if I have a number of images with similar details, I can do them all together with a click (or two) of my mouse. But don\'t think this exhausts the range of software possibilities for captioning pictures. Even the most inexpensive image-processing software can handle this job to some degree these days. If you haven\'t yet done so, take a look to see just what yours will do. Oh! Before we continue - and only for your information, \"IPTC\" stands for International Press Telecommunications Council (Standard) and is the accepted model for how journalistic captions are to be produced.</p>\r\n<p>The IPTC three screenshots below pertain to these first two photographs. The first of these screen shots below exhibits the Photo Shop software screen associated with \"File Information.\" As a pull-down, it is simply filled out according the photographer\'s (and/or editor\'s) needs. That is, not all aspects of the form need to be utilized. As you see, mine is a \"bare-bones\" account of happenings, attribution and copyright particulars. The second of these screen shots pertains to the Photo Shop page titled, Origin\" and carries information indicating when and where the shot was made. It should be noted here, that because I use this latter page to record location, I do not place it in the caption space. Similarly, I do not duplicate \"Key Words\" in my captions and visa-versa. By following this strategy, I make the most of word searches from these IPTC pages.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Since we\'ve touched on keywords, let me say just a few more things about them here. All IPTC pages include an entry field for them (e.g. <em>Photo Shop </em>- first image above / <em>Photo Mechanic</em> - third image above) and their listing serves two very important purposes. First, to help you find your own digitally-filed work, quickly. Secondly - keywords when done thoughtfully, are a primary market resource for editors selling your work. For both reasons, five of the most identifying and accurate keyword choices should accompany every IPTC page you save to your computer. Aim for broad and obvious categorizations (e.g. man, woman, children, etc.) instead of specifics when it comes to choosing your keywords. That said, think too of what emotions might be evoked by these images and don\'t fail to include these among your keyword choices.</p>\r\n<p>A further collection of information that digital cameras auto-record for you and that I\'ve found to come in handy more than once, is that located on the Metadata page. The image below exemplifies such a page as seen through the Photo Mechanic software. Documented here are all the camera settings used in the making of each photo, the make of camera in service, focal length of the lens, as well as the date and time the shot was made. I find this information often beneficial in putting together my captions - at least the exact when? and where? of photos. But even the technical data of aperture and shutter speed recorded help me to better analyze and improve my own work.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',16,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-21 11:55:07','2015-05-06 09:34:27'),(124,42,'Finding an Audience',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Packaging the work. Getting your best foot in the door. Where to go from here.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Now that you\'ve taken your first steps in a documentary photographer\'s shoes, learned what a picture- story is and have produced one yourself, the next step is seeing if it can be published. This was a scary move for me when I first began a number of years ago. But it\'s an exciting one, one to be learned from and - for me - a necessary advance to becoming the working photojournalist I wanted to be. I\'ve never looked back! So if you feel a similar motivation, here\'s the way to see it to the next level.</p>\r\n<p>What you hold in your possession right now is a body of work that has taken you seven weeks to produce. You have shot it, edited it, polished it to the best it can be and added the journalistic details in the form of captions. The product is ready for packaging and delivery to market. Just how this is done follows a rather prescribed course of action, traditional to the editorial field.</p>\r\n<p>The process begins with a so-called query. For those of you who don\'t feel writing is your forte\', have no fear. You\'ve already put together a photo-story synopsis, earlier in the course. The query is just a little bit longer (keep it to one type-written page). It presents the facts and details surrounding your proposed visual submission and asks - point-blank - if the editor or publisher is interested in buying your work. As you can imagine, editors are an over-worked and stressed-out lot. They see many queries on a daily basis. Some pass hardly without notice. These queries are too skimpy on presentation, lack focus or simply don\'t fit the market. It is for this latter reason, only, that many fall short. And such could be avoided if only submitters would first do their homework.</p>\r\n<p>There are lots of special-interest magazines on the racks today. One way to peruse them is to pay a visit to the local bookstore, library or newspaper and magazine stand. You often need not buy, but at least take a look to see if the publication is right for the material you have to offer.</p>\r\n<p>A more thorough way to conduct your \"paper\" research is to consult the \"Photographer\'s Market\", published and up-dated annually and available through bookstores and on-line handlers. This volume catalogues a comprehensive list of national publications. Each entry is complete with a short description of the types of work used, how much is paid on acceptance, if freelance material is considered and, very importantly, the name of the editor in charge. When you submit work, always make sure you address it directly to that he or she who makes the decision. And be sure to spell their name correctly. Below is an example of a query letter. This one I sent to an editor not too long ago. And in part due to the timeliness of the subject, my photo-story was accepted. It\'s important, of course, to include some images (3 - 6 are plenty) from the story to peak an editor\'s interest and give an idea of the quality of work you do.</p>\r\n<p>Yet another and growing outlet for material is, of course, the internet. In fact, numerous publications listed in \"Photographer\'s Market\" have also \"online\" editions - additional space for which freelance material can be considered. Oftentimes such sites are a path of \"lesser resistance\" for photographers seeking that first publication.Below is an example of a query letter I wrote not long ago. It proposes a story about the dangers faced by trekking porters in the Karakoram Mountain Range of northern Pakistan.</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Carrying it to Extremes: Porters in the High Karakoram</strong></p>\r\n<p>On the 29th of June, 2006, five Balti villagers from Pakistan drowned on their way to the world\'s second highest peak - K2. Accompanying an Italian alpine team, the five made a bid to shave time from their scheduled arrival at base camp, packing equipment and supplies. Their incentive for doing so was additional pay. Seeing the crossing of Sang Sang Choo stream on the Baltoro Glacier as a short-cut, they opted to make a go of it, instead of walking the few kilometers upstream to a secure foot-bridge. But the rush of water resulting from mid-day melt, proved far too much. All five were swept away by the current, their bodies yet to be found. For 150 years foreigners have been passing through Karakoram villages on their way to the high peaks of this 2,415-kilometer, crescent-shaped continuation of the Greater Himalaya. Their trekking and mountaineering endeavors have heavily depended upon labor supplied by local villagers, willing to carrying loads of 30 - 40 kilograms on their backs, for a price. Along the glaciers and over some of the highest passes on earth, trekking porters have managed this with poor equipment and little more than a blanket and plastic tarp to protect them at night. All this and all too often, only to learn at the end of the trek or expedition that they would receive far less pay than they originally had been promised.</p>\r\n<p>World-changing September 11, 2001 altered these lives, too. Far fewer climbers and trekkers visited the Pakistan Karakoram in those intervening years leading up to the present. In 2006, however, things were fortunately better for the adventure travel industry in Pakistan. This year has witnessed a surge in the number of trekkers and alpinists to the region (more than 50 expeditions in 2004, from a low of 24 in 2002 versus a high of 72 in 2001 (prior to 9/11)). This being the K2 fifty-year anniversary of the first Italian ascent has also prompted more foreigners to visit Pakistan for mountain travel. While the financial benefits of the current situation are obvious, the significant increase in numbers of trekkers and climbers has caused a porter shortage. It has pushed payment per porter to 5,000 Pakistani Rupees ($58 USD) for carrying a trekker\'s load from the traditional trail-head at Askole, to the high glacial junction at Concordia (a 7-day journey, on average). The situation has drawn many inexperienced and young porters to the labor pool, making the relationship between employer and employee an exploitive one. Accidents and injuries are a result. Like the occurrence at Sang Sang Choo, the outcome can even be fatal.</p>\r\n<p>Included below are samples of work from this coverage.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Are you interested in this photo-story?</p>\r\n<p>Thank you,</p>\r\n<p>Signature</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Notice that a query builds a case for its acceptance through facts only. Don\'t try to dazzle. Leave that to your images. Also, there still aren\'t a lot of publications that will accept queries on-line, so be sure your letterhead, 8x10-inch prints and packaging are done in a professional way. Don\'t forget, too, to include a stamped, self-addressed envelope for any material you may want returned. Give editors two to three weeks before you contact them with a follow-up letter or e-mail, but don\'t let this part slip. Persistence is valued in this business and it can still get you in the door. Be hard-necked, but polite. There are tales of photographers who have papered their walls with rejection letters before that first break comes through. And when success does hit, no matter at what level, build on it! Use that \"tear-sheet\" to approach other markets with bigger budgets and wider circulations. Remember: Be organized, never promise what you can\'t deliver and submit your work on time. More you can\'t control.</p>',16,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-21 11:56:06','2015-05-21 12:44:09'),(125,42,'Grammar of Visual Storytelling',NULL,'<p><strong>Take a lesson from Hollywood. Parallels with the written word. Shooting from every which-way and down.</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you\'re a watcher of television and movies, you already have a working knowledge of how a photo-story is put together. Don\'t worry if you can\'t sit down and outline that knowledge, most of it probably lies in your subconscious.</p>\r\n<p>Our job in this lesson is to delineate the kinds of shots you need to be looking for and making in order to move your picture story efficiently and effectively on its way toward an effective conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s begin with what I mean by, \"grammar\" in visual form. Sorry if the term itself is a turn-off. When I think back to school days there might be a slight bitter taste in mouth, too. I\'ll do my best to put a fresh \"spin\" on the concept. Start by thinking of images as elements in a sentence. Sentences, of course, have a subject, verb, direct and indirect objects, adjectives, etc. Picture stories and shorter photo-essays have these, as well. The grammatical counterparts here are: wide-angle (over-view / scene-setting) shots, middle-distance shots, close-up (detail / \"point\") shots and \"point-of-view\" images. The latter are a little harder to come by, but not impossible to capture. Think of them as \"icing on the cake.\" We\'ll talk more about this shortly.</p>\r\n<p>Now, think for a moment about how a movie unfolds. All the shots that I\'ve just described occur during the running of a Hollywood flick, or any other type of movie for that matter. The scene is set - perhaps a village square, shot from above during an annual festival. From here, the camera might then shift to a table set up where fashionably-dressed guests raise their glasses in toast to the occasion. Suddenly, one of the women at the table faints and slips to the ground. The camera zooms in on her hand still clutching a champagne glass. Next the camera pulls back to reveal a curious crowd encircling the scene, and so on. This same or similar orchestration of images is what can be found in every effectively told photo-story, too.</p>\r\n<p>A written story follows this same basic formula, whether it\'s a short-story or a full-blown novel. Take a look! There is also variety (if it\'s well written) in any piece of writing. This can be found in the form of word order expressed in sentences. Furthermore, sentences themselves vary in terms of paragraph length, etc. Visual stories are the same way. The goal is to hold the viewer\'s interest (or sell magazines, from the editor\'s point of view), whilst getting your message across with interest.</p>\r\n<p>The visual aspect of story-telling, however, adds another layer to this process. That means variety in terms of horizontal shots (landscape format) and verticals (portrait format), as well as differences in color, if color is what you\'re working in. As a photojournalist - a visual story-teller - you should shoot for an aesthetic and effective combination of all of these elements.</p>\r\n<p>Coverage of movie billboard painters in Delhi, India, included the first three photographs below. I became interested in this story when I\'d heard that the long-standing tradition of painting Bollywood\'s film advertisements by hand was becoming a dying art. When I investigated, I found only two remaining studios and decided that coverage was in order. These three images were all made at the same location. The studio employed seven persons, including assistants, apprentices and two master painters who, themselves, began as young boys at the bottom of this workshop hierarchy.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The neighborhood shot at the top conveys the level of activity I encountered at this studio and the context in which it is found. For me, this wide-angle view of things would do well as a scene-setter, because it conveys the \"chaotic\" (at least to western eyes) and social intimacy that is India and Indian society.</p>\r\n<p>A middle-distance shot, made with a 50mm lens, is represented in the second of these images.&nbsp; Its purpose is to draw the viewer closer to the action and further into the story. In this instance, a master painter is shown working on one of his canvases. As an aside, it\'s interesting to note that these works are not unique pieces. The studio will turn out one after the other - perhaps up to a dozen - in the exact same style - right to the last detail. The canvases, or in some cases plastic banners, are then hung up to dry, as seen in the first picture.&nbsp; Once dry - a matter of hours in the hot Indian sun - the works are rolled and placed on an overnight train to reach their destinations by morning. What I played on visually in this second photograph are the eyes appearing throughout the composition - repetition of form to lend strength to my interpretation of what was taking place.</p>\r\n<p>Last of the photos above is a close-up, detail or so-called, \"point\" shot. Such perspectives focus the viewer\'s attention and lend immediacy to the story. In this particular example, a painter takes a break next to a pile of movie studio advertisements, distributed by the production companies and used by billboard painters to guide their work. I like the way the figure on the page is \"looking\" up toward the artist, as if to be asking - \"What\'s next?\" - and that is why I chose to include it in my coverage.</p>\r\n<p>You might be curious as to where I got the idea for this story in the first place. The chain of events went like this. I had a free day in New Delhi following an assignment in Rajasthan, in the western part of the subcontinent. For the next two days, I would be in the city and searched for something to work on. Just walking around the city center, I noticed large color ads for movies on walls nearly everywhere. By chance I happened upon a young, local tour guide in search of work. I asked him what he knew of the billboard situation and he told me the story and added that one of the two remaining studios was located in his neighborhood - just \"right place at the right time\" kind of luck! I hired the chap and the next day we visited and photographed both of the remaining studios to make pictures. Photography can be very serendipitous; you just have to been open to things happening and be prepared when they do!</p>\r\n<p>Another example of the types of shots it takes to build a good photo-story is the one below. The following three images were made in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, where I was investigating primitive brick factories and how they affected peoples\' lives (mostly poor migrant workers from India) and the environment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><br />{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The first of this series shows an overview of the situation, with the firing-kiln in the background. In the foreground of this photograph are laborers digging clay and forming raw bricks to be baked. The process is a hard one physically and the air pollution the industry produces, affects everyone who lives in this bowl-shaped valley.</p>\r\n<p>A \"middle-distance\" shot portrayed in the next, shows fired bricks being removed from the kiln. It takes 48 hours to completely bake the bricks to usable form. From this shot, the viewer gets an idea of the dust and heat that workers must endure for a very low daily payment.</p>\r\n<p>The final image in this series is a close-up portrait view of the brick-workers themselves.&nbsp; I wanted here to show both how young many of these laborers are and give the viewer a sense of the lung-congesting air they must breathe all day long. Images like this are used in a photo-story to drive home a point and to bring impact to the whole.</p>',17,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-21 11:58:28','2015-03-14 15:19:17'),(126,43,'Wide to Ultra Wide',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Learning the \"language\" of wide-angle. Prime or a zoom? Which view is right for you?</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>For many an uninitiated photographer, wide-angle lenses are the ones reached for when vistas are sweeping or quarters too cramped for an additional step backwards, in order to squeeze all in the frame. Wide-angle lenses are certainly for this, but to use them only in this manner does a real disservice to this extraordinary category of optical glass. They are capable of so much more.</p>\r\n<p>With diagonal views from 63 degrees (35mm / approximately 22mm using a 1.6 crop-factor digital sensor) to an ultra-expansive 114 degrees (14mm / well into the 8mm fish-eye range with a 1.6 sensor), wide-angle lenses offer the photographer the ability to command and control amounts of visual information far in excess of that offered by lenses in the standard (50mm / 31mm using a crop-factor sensor of 1.6) through telephoto range.</p>\r\n<p>From the purely technical standpoint, wide-angles are much easier to use than their longer focal-length counterparts. They offer much greater depth-of-field and dramatically reduce the effect of camera-shake. Take the first photograph below for example, shot in Paris\'s central train station. This exposure was made hand-held at 1/8 sec. under somewhat low-light conditions. Using a 28mm lens set at aperture f8, I was able to give an impression of just how long this express train awaiting passengers is. Even a \"standard\" 50mm lens set in this way might easily display unsteadiness throughout the frame. With a telephoto and no tripod, there would have been no way to successfully negotiate this shot and have it be sharp, throughout.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>On the compositional side of things, wide-angle lenses present the photographer with a whole new array of challenges - and opportunities - that can open the door to almost endless photographic creativity. Topping the list, is engaging more personally with the subject, whatever that center of interest might be. Here are two examples.</p>\r\n<p>Photographed with a 24mm lens and an aperture set at f16, the second photo below lends a feeling of \"vastness\" to this remote landscape of eastern Afghanistan. Positioned some distance from the camera, the main subject of this composition serves to emphasize the relative \"insignificance\" of human presence amid this semi-desert land.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The next image brings a different view. Here, too, the lens used was 24mm in focal length, but this time from a compositional perspective, the \"feel\" is altogether different. Positioning myself near to this group caught in awe of the world\'s second tallest mountain - K2 in Pakistan, I\'ve \"enlisted\" the viewer as a member of this trekking party. This more direct engagement adds strength to the photograph, bringing the viewer closer to being there and being a part of what\'s happening.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>There\'s a second compositional feature characteristic of wide-angle lenses and it\'s probably the one that most challenges the uninitiated photographer. This is the complexity inherent in the \"exaggerated\" perspective offered by wide-angle lenses. Wide-angle pictures are - well - just bigger, much more expansive in their field of view. And the wider you go, the more perspective you\'ve got to deal with. Besides that, wide-angle compositions contain elements within the frame that lie at varying distances from one another, and from the camera. The photograph below provides a case in point.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>This photograph is taken from a story I did on brick factories in Nepal. The subjects are a husband and wife team forming clay bricks for firing. What they earned for this was a meager daily wage, but together it was enough for this landless family to live on. In terms of the actual distance that separated these two, it was probably about half of what it appears here to be. The 20mm lens I used to tie them together, and they to other elements throughout the frame, was set at aperture f16. With this extensive depth of field I was able to keep everything sharp and identifiable. And although there was a lot to deal with here, I believe my \"management\" choices were effective. I was able to show their collaboration in this workplace away from home.</p>\r\n<p>In my own camera bag I frequently carry several lenses in the 35mm to 16mm range. Two of these - my favorites in fact, are fixed focal-length lenses or \"primes,\" as they are often referred to. As opposed to zoom lenses in the wide-angle category, primes give the photographer just a single perspective from which to capture the scene. Any \"zooming\" must be done with the feet - walking closer or farther away from the subject. This can be a disadvantage in some situations - crowds, for example. Here, camera position cannot be so quickly and easily changed.</p>\r\n<p>Another advantage zooms have over primes, of course, is that they are much lighter to carry (and usually less expensive in total) than the three or four primes they replace. A two-fold advantage held by high quality primes, however, is that they most often possess wider apertures and are, thus, more suited to low-light photography. And, they can sometimes still deliver a sharper result than primes, although with computer-aided design of lenses these days, this is always open to debate. One thing is for certain though, for high quality prime lenses in any focal length, you\'re guaranteed to pay more. You need to be sure that those couple to a few extra f-stops of aperture are all that important to the way you shoot.</p>\r\n<p>Inherent in your wide-angle choice too, is just which focal length to \"call your own\". Here are the choices, with a few attendant pros and cons:</p>\r\n<p>A 35mm lens is just a small step wider than the \"normal\" 50mm lens that many of us began in photography with. For candid work, the 35mm is a good choice. It offers an increased depth of field over that of the 50mm and its relatively broadened perspective makes precise framing much less important when working close to the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Both of these characteristics are expressed in the picture that follows. This black &amp; white photograph was made in the desert of Rajasthan, India, adjacent the Pakistan border. The subject is a village chief of the settlement in the background. Using a prime 35mm lens set at f16 and 1/125 sec., I was able to candidly photograph this man as he passed closely before my camera. For the image I wanted - and got, a 35mm lens was the perfect choice for capturing this man and some of the environmental context in which he lives.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The first \"true\" wide-angle is the 28mm. The selection of apertures for the prime version of this lens tends to be limited in comparison to that found with 35\'s, but depth of field in the 28mm category shows a definite increase over the former focal length. Photographing at aperture f5.6, for example, one can expect sharp images of subjects between 5 to 10 feet (1.5 to 3 meters), making it an excellent choice for photojournalism and candid street photography, in general.</p>\r\n<p>At the \"ultra\" end of the wide-angle lens spectrum (i.e. 20mm, 24mm, 16mm and 14mm), some detectable stretching of objects near the edges of the frame begin to become visible. This \"wide-angle distortion\" as it\'s often referred to, is not really distortion at all, but simply the natural consequence of imaging over such a wide angle, with a rectilinear perspective. Fact is, using lenses wider than 20mm begins to get challenging on several levels. In crowds, for instance, it\'s easy to bump into people as you attempt to compose your subject in the viewfinder. Things are really closer to your lens than they appear through it to be.</p>\r\n<p>A second characteristic of lenses at the ultra end of the wide-angle range is the convergence of vertical lines as the camera is tilted from the horizontal plane. The greater the angle, the stronger the effect becomes. For some this phenomenon is disturbing - buildings leaning, faces slightly elongated. Nowadays, all of this can be rectified during the digital post-processing of images. Personally, though, I\'ve always appreciated this unique characteristic of wide-angle lenses and the creative possibilities it brings. Take one final example.</p>\r\n<p>In the final photograph presented below, I have used the strong convergence potential of a 16mm lens to accentuate, through elongation, this new modern shopping, restaurant and hotel complex in the Afghan capital of Kabul. Standing on the ground floor, I set me camera at 1/30 sec. and aperture f16, made my camera solid against a hand railing and tilted it skyward to include all the mezzanine landings. The final step was to wait until both elevators were in just the \"right\" position. The photograph I received from this is alive with light, energy and \"stature\".</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-23 07:37:35','2015-02-23 07:42:59'),(127,43,'Establishing Strong Foregrounds',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Close is cool. Hyper-focal what? Dare experimentation.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>There\'s a synergy that happens when you\'re photographing close to your subject - a sort of \"mix\" of you and \"they\". The result is usually something far different from what you\'d get by standing across the street with a long lens.</p>\r\n<p>If your subject is an inanimate object, you\'ll take greater notice of its form and how this fits best into the whole of your composition. When the center of interest is \"plant\", you\'ll look more closely at its precise form, structure and texture. In the first photo below for instance, I\'ve gotten down low to the ground in order to place this high-altitude desert vegetation in the immediate foreground of my frame. In the process of doing so, I was brought to more intimately observe the tough fronds this plant had developed, in response to the harsh environmental conditions it faces. From this perspective, I went on to include elements I saw through the viewfinder, that would best describe this adaptation - this relationship of nature. From 10 feet (3 meters) away, holding a 70 - 200mm zoom, such would have not been nearly as effective, in terms of what I\'m describing here.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>If your subject falls into the \"safely-approachable animal\" category - a family pet or creature in the tamer \"wilds\" of the local zoo, for example - you\'ll most certainly come away with some sort of acknowledgment of the encounter. It might be in the form of a gaping yawn or at the very least, an inquisitive look into the lens that adds a \"sense of moment\", to your picture.</p>\r\n<p><br />One of the latter I\'ve captured, is presented in next.&nbsp; These are \"Dzo\" - a hybrid cross between a yak and a domesticated cow and I\'m within breath-shot (not really as bad as it sounds), in the wilds of Bhutan. The lens I\'m using is a 24mm, a focal length that\'s easier to control than the 20mm, yet still \"edgier\" than a 28mm. My aim was to somewhat elongate the muzzle of this creature closest to my camera, while continuing - \"echoing\" - this motif in the background.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>From \"things\" - to animals - to humans, is bit of a transition, but it need not be an uncomfortable one, in the least. All that\'s required for photographing people in close quarters, is a bit of the \"gift of gab\" (gesturing and \"sign language\" where foreign languages pose a challenge) and a healthy blend of politeness and respect, where strangers are concerned.</p>\r\n<p>A good entry point to the human end of subject continuum using a wide-angle lens, is with family and friends. They\'ll be the most receptive and patient, of course, with your first forays into this approach to photography. After this, street performers are an excellent group with which to begin photographing those you don\'t know. Toss a few coins into their hat or instrument case, assume a front-row seat and shoot away. Another coin or two at the close of your session will undoubtedly insure more photos, should you decide to return with your camera in the future.</p>\r\n<p>I did a similar thing not long ago on the streets of Perugia, Italy - shown in the next photo - where I came across this young accordion player. Once more with a 24mm lens, I eased my way to the front of the small group of onlookers, watched for a while with my camera in plain view and then slipped small change into his collection box. Then getting down to a low perspective, I took a light-meter reading from his face and began to shoot up toward him, attempting to capture the most animated and poignant moments of this young man\'s performance.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Why the low perspective? Getting down low and photographing \"up over\" the subject with a wide-angle lens \"accentuates\" the stature and action of that person. The result is a heightened degree of \"dynamism\" throughout the frame. Use this technique when opportunity allows, but be aware that it\'s not universally applicable. Give it some practice and you\'ll quickly gain a feel for when it\'s compositionally \"right\" and when it\'s not.</p>\r\n<p>Before we continue, I want to say a few things about \"distortion\" as it relates to photographing people with wide-angle lenses. The key to controlling this, is to ensure that your camera is always held as close to the horizontal plane as possible. On a personal note, however, I\'ll add that I\'m not really that disturbed by \"portraits\" that elongate the human face or figure to some degree. That is, I find the result to be oftentimes quite visually interesting.</p>\r\n<p>I put this philosophy to practice in the photo that follows.&nbsp; The locale is Leh, capital city of the Asian country, Ladakh. The elderly woman is a nomad who has left - with her family - her traditional home and lifestyle on the high plateau in the north of the country, in search of an easier life in the city. In this photographic moment I am greeted at the front gate of the family\'s urban compound. The woman\'s hand gesture and somewhat elongated form, interpreted here with a 20mm lens, add emphasis and expression to her stature and - correspondingly - to the dignity she possesses as a member of her culture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Putting a wide-angle lens\'s expansive perspective on the world to full application, has a lot to do with focus. Hyper-focal distance is usually the term tossed about in this regard. When it\'s depth-of-field (DOF) you\'re after, you\'ll always achieve the greatest amount of it when you set focus at your lens\'s \"hyper-focal distance\". So, how does it work?</p>\r\n<p>Whenever focusing your lens on a subject, there will be an area of sharp focus and that which is not in focus at all. The area of most defined focus is called the, \"focal plane\". The important thing to remember here is that one-third of the focal plane lies in front of the subject (which is sharply focused on) and two-thirds of it falls behind the subject. Focus your lens at \"infinity\" and the leading edge of the area that is in sharp focus, is the \"hyper-focal point\" for the lens you are using. Focus on that point (instead of infinity), and you\'ll have the greatest range of focus - from infinity, clear back to your camera\'s position. The quickest and most practical way to attain \"hyper-focal distance\" in your pictures, is simply to focus on a point that falls one-third of the way into your scene.</p>\r\n<p>This I\'ve done in the final photograph below.&nbsp; Made in Nepal, I used a 35mm lens set at aperture f16 and 1/125 second, focused most sharply on a point in the lake - approximately a third of the way to the horizon - and composed my photograph. In the latter respect, notice that I established strong and immediate foreground interest in the boats and the woman making eye contact with the incoming paddlers. Her line-of-sight, drawn diagonally (diagonal lines lend energy and dynamism to compositions) from main subject (woman) to the boats on the horizon, tie this composition together and guide the viewer\'s eye from foreground, into the middle-distance and on to the horizon in the far background of the shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-23 07:38:39','2015-02-23 13:08:12'),(128,43,'Thinking Full Frame',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Life to the edges - and beyond. Thinking \"layers\". Creating internal logic.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The wide-angle frame is certainly a unique space to fill. It\'s like the large empty room of a house that begs for furnishings. But not just anything will do and certainly all must be arranged in an expressive and aesthetically pleasing manner. This is pretty much the challenge of wide-angle photography, too.</p>\r\n<p>There are basically two ways to effectively accomplish this task when attaching a wide-angle lens to your camera. The first of these techniques is to move close and fill the frame in its entirety with the subject. For example, take a look at the photograph below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Made in one of my favourite places to work - the Asian country of Nepal, I photographed this street-side thangka painter, displaying his talents publicly to passers-by. My lens was a 35mm, used by some photographers as a \"normal\" or \"standard\" (50mm) focal length substitute. In this case, I wanted to come close in order to show the delicacy of this man\'s work and still include as much of the shop\'s context as possible. With anything wider than my choice, I would have had to compositionally deal with everything else than surrounded the man\'s tiny work space. Not that the busy street with cows, bicycles and all sorts of people wouldn\'t have been \"context\" for the shop and its owner too, such was just not my message in this case. Notice also that this photograph \"happens\" on basically one focal plane, meaning that only a moderate depth-of-field (e.g. f4.5 - f5.6) was required to create the photograph I was after.</p>\r\n<p>Shooting in the rich, late afternoon sunlight that one encounters often along the Arabian Sea coast of Kerala in South India, I again put my 35mm lens to use in order to tightly frame this group of young Muslim school girls, as they posed on the beach for the photo appearing below.&nbsp; Main subject of this composition is the smaller girl with the large smile, set just slightly off-center. I focused most sharply on her eyes and then ran my own eye - through the viewfinder - around its edges before squeezing the shutter button. What I was looking for here, were just the right combination and division of faces \"breaking\" the frame. By this I mean those faces and figures that appear to be \"straddling\" the frame\'s edges. The overall impression is that this group of girls is much larger than the frame here allows - that it actually \"overlaps\" the frame and continues for some distance, beyond the frame\'s borders. The technique of \"breaking the frame\" works to some degree with lenses of most focal lengths, but adds greater interpretive (even psychological) power when it\'s applied to wide-angle photography and the power potential it visually holds.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Still another method for managing the expansive frame of wide-angle compositions is to think in terms of \"layers\" - horizontal \"zones\" from foreground, through middle-distance to the farthermost horizon. Consider the next two photos.&nbsp; Both possess a strong depth-of-field. And, each identifies a theme that is first introduced through the establishment of strong and immediate foreground interest.&nbsp; In the first of these examples below, made in a poppy field of Central Asia, I set an aperture of f16 on my wide-angle zoom placed at 16mm. I then focused on a point approximately one-third of the way into the scene (thus approximating \"hyper-focal distance\" and assuring optimal sharpness throughout the picture) and positioned myself inches away from a particularly stunning bloom. By placing this main subject on the center-line of the frame, a symmetry and sense of calm was brought to the picture. The overall compositional result in this expansive, wide-angle view is one of orchestration and harmony, in which like elements are \"echoed\" - in sharp-focus - throughout the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The second example just above, is a similar situation and treatment, thereof. Shot at Dal Lake near the heart of Kashmir\'s capital city, Srinagar, this scene is one of traditional boats used to get about the city\'s extensive waterways. This time equipping my camera with a 20mm lens, I set aperture at f16 and focused a third of the way into the scene (hyper-focal distance), choosing as the composition\'s center-of-interest, the boy playing with the paddle. The woman in the boat adjacent takes the viewer\'s eye deeper into the scene via the line of her sight across the lake - through a thematically similar middle-ground and on to a horizon full of similar watercraft. With a single boat breaking the left side of the frame, the inference is made that the scene continues unobstructed, which intensifies the viewer\'s engagement with the picture. The compositional result is a photograph that is not only expansive, but expressive in its \"oneness\" of subject.</p>\r\n<p>When visual space is at its optimum, as it increasingly is with wider and wider lenses, visual \"integrity\" within compositions becomes all the more important. By this I mean that It is what unifies the picture and brings strength to its message.</p>\r\n<p>Photographed at a Sikh temple in India\'s capital, New Delhi, the picture below is an image where it\'s not at all clear just what message its creator was intending to send. Just how these selected elements logically fit together, remains obscure. As a background aside, this photograph is actually part of twelve-picture story. The role of this photo is to introduce the idea of \"confusion\" that could surround just which of the Sikh religion\'s many prophets to most closely follow. As a single picture, however, its not at all clear just what the elements within this frame have - \"logically\" - in common with one another. Solution? Take steps forward to remove the figure on the left entirely from the frame. Then, filling the frame completely (and even breaking the frame) with these background pictures, would give you a shot similar to those in the very first two photographs at the top of this lesson.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>In counterpoint to this photo, the last below is an example of a photographic composition that does exhibit \"internal logic / visual integrity\" within the frame. Beginning with an immediate and strong foreground subject (the collection of soccer balls), the theme run to the assemblage of officials in the background, set to hand out tournament awards. All elements in this picture fit logically together, supporting one another, throughout the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-23 07:39:24','2015-02-23 12:59:31'),(129,43,'Wide as Standard Lens',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Test drive your new choice. What to do with all that light. Exit the extraneous.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>I have no doubts that wide-angle is the way I see the world. When a potential subject catches my eye, I immediately look to see what surrounds it. What the \"parts of the whole\" mean to that center-of-interest that fascinates me. This is what I cherish most about these compact and unobtrusive pieces of glass, known as wide-angle lenses - just how much of a story they can tell in one fell swoop.</p>\r\n<p>As you\'re beginning to sense by now, the world of wide-angle is a touch of the \"Wild West\", as far as \"no hard-and-fast rules\" is concerned. It\'s a bit like the \"wide-open spaces\" when you consider the expansive qualities of this category of glass. What binds the two together to yield commanding and expressive photographs, are exactly the things we\'ve covered to-date in this course. Holding to this \"cowboy\" metaphor a step further, the photographer must decide if he or she will go with a mildly frisky - yet easily controllable - 35mm mount, a full-on \"edgy\" and free-ranging 14mm choice, or something degrees intermediate, between.</p>\r\n<p>Like most starting out in photography, the first lens I owned was a 50mm. It was my \"everything\" lens - for wide views when I stood back and close-ups when I \"zoomed in\" with my feet. Thing was, I wanted both - in the same lens - and when I purchased my first 35mm prime, I began to get it. And, although I use a 50mm lens a lot, too, today (mainly for portraiture), the 35mm quickly became my lens of choice as \"standard\".</p>\r\n<p>I\'d been using this combination regularly for about a year when the picture below was made. Shot in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal, I composed this photograph more \"environmentally\" than would have been achieved with a 50mm fixed in place. By this, I mean that I was able to include contextual elements that directly support the subject of this picture - the \"Doko\", or basket for portaging heavy loads in this part of the world (positioned in this frame according to the \"Rule-of-Thirds\" guideline - bottom left intersection of lines).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Among \"environmental\" elements contained within this frame, are the three departing porters in sharp middle-distance, each carrying the thematically-repeated motif on their back. On the equally sharp horizon, mountain peaks \"echo\" the porters\' upright form. Thus, a layered-like harmony of shapes, combined with a minimal color palette, weave this composition together and send a simple and clear message to the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>Having worked for a short period with the 28mm, I found it just was no longer enough to capture the exact \"feel\" I had in mind. That was \"then\" and the photo below is \"now\". The \"edgier\" 24mm wide-angle has been the lens that stays on my camera body most of the time these days. This is very much a \"social\" lens, meaning that one must come well within \"private\" space (a meter / 3 feet or less) to use it effectively. It may not always be easy and safe to get me there, but when in this position, I work my best.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>With a store-front window to protect me from the oder and a city sidewalk to clearly mark my escape route, this photo met neither of the criteria mentioned just above. Composed in the Turkish quarter of Cologne, Germany, I used the 24mm at close distance to capture sales activity on a busy Saturday morning. Elements to notice in this environmental glimpse of a fish handler include: \"leading-lines\" drawn by the orientation of displayed fish, pointing the viewer into the composition; a frame filled with customers - inside and out; a \"sense-of-moment\" contained in the brightly-gloved hand of a salesman, reaching to the immediate foreground of the picture; and the reflections throughout, adding a view to the street beyond.</p>\r\n<p>Employing the same lens, but focusing now on a scene dimensionally more extensive, the next photograph presented even more of a wide-angle challenge. The setting is the Taj Mahal in Agra, India, but from a perspective that few visitors enjoy. I rose at 4 a.m. to make my way from hotel to the other side of the Yamuna River, giving a back-view of this famous structure. Engaging the services of a boatman on the scene, I disembarked at a sandbar in mid-stream and positioned myself for sunrise. From here, I studied the surroundings, noting just what I\'d include in my picture once the dawn light hit its peak. Sunrise perfection only lasts a few minutes and during this time I worked fast to get just the composition I wanted. My checklist for this included, boatman, reflections in the water, the Taj of course and rising sun, positioned carefully behind an outlying minaret.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Photography is most basically, \"painting with light\". And, as lenses become more expansive, greater amounts of light become available to \"manage\". The photograph below is a case in point of the axiom, \"more-to-control-the-wider-you-go\". Shot again on the Yamuna River, I turned from my sandbar position on this occasion to see a villager and his wife making their ways across the expanse of dry-season water. The two - wife a distance behind her man - were headed directly toward me and I readied my camera by taking a light-meter reading from the back of my hand (middle tone / identical light and direction). I chose my 16mm lens set at f16 for this shot. I wanted to emphasize - and exaggerate to a degree - the flat river plain in its present state. Getting down low and visualizing just where I wanted to place the man\'s wading feet in my picture, I focused a third of the way into the scene (hyper-focal setting), moved slightly to the side to secure the woman\'s position in the composition and made my picture when the village man arrived. Being an uncomplicated scene in terms of subject and background, this photograph was easy to \"control,\" even with a lens of such all-encompassing focal power.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Standing counterpoint to the artist who produces a work through the addition of pigment layers, a photographer creates through subtraction of unnecessary elements from the frame. Pertaining to \"internal logic\" and \"visual integrity\" discussed earlier in the course, this has practically to do with positioning oneself with camera - closer, farther, higher or lower, such that elements seen in the viewfinder stand together as a visual \"whole\". If there is something present that doesn\'t directly support the subject and message of the composition, it needs to be removed. To this end, the very last thing I\'ve gotten in the habit of doing just before squeezing the shutter button, is to run my eye clockwise around the edge of the viewfinder. If there\'s something there that shouldn\'t be, I quickly shift camera position to get it out - or, I find a way to \"hide it\" behind something else in the frame.</p>\r\n<p>Both of the following two photo examples speak to the process of removing the extraneous. The first of these photos (just below) was made in one of the last remaining cinema billboard workshops in India, housed in a part of the capital known as, Old Delhi. Despite its loss of business to computer-aided graphics, there was much hustle and bustle about this studio the day I arrived. Working on a feature story for magazine publication, I wanted to show in this shot, finished billboards being removed for distribution throughout the city. A first look through the viewfinder and 24mm lens brought way too many elements into play - people sipping tea on the perimeter - this and that having no direct relationship to the subject. It took a few steps closer to focus in on this worker lugging pieces from warehouse storage - under the \"watchful eye\" of the next to go.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The final image of this lesson is another example of isolating what you want with a wide-angle lens. Perched atop a pedal-rickshaw amid the hectic traffic of Bangladesh\'s capital city, Dhaka, I was faced with harsh mid-day sun for starters. This would have stopped many a photographer right there, but I\'m more of the opinion that, \"any light is good light\", as long as it\'s used in the right way. In this case, I focused on the hard-edged shadows and just how they might compliment my composition. Being unable to get much closer, perched in the passenger seat, I pulled my \"standard\" 24mm lens from the camera and snapped a 28mm into place. This offered me better control over extraneous light, \"painted\" to every side of me. To further reduce the problem, I bent forward in my seat to eliminate everything but peddling feet and sharp shadow cast by the front wheel of my transport - all enough to constitute wide-angle expression.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-23 07:40:02','2015-02-23 17:17:32'),(130,44,'Photo Fundamentals for Food Photography',NULL,'<p>When it comes to photographing food, the basics of digital photography are really no different than those of other photographic genres. It is important to know the basics and have a solid understating of aspects like aperture, shutter, speed and ISO before you venture into food photography. Food photography are still life images and as food photographers we have to depend on using these tools as creatively as possible to compose a photo that comes to life and make mouths water for the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>Regardless of the camera brand, certain key settings and modes will always be available and it is critical for a photographer to know how to use these universal tools of the trade. You can use these tools individually to create specific results, but knowing how to use them together in a controlled and balanced way will really bring out the magic in your images and the results you want to see.</p>\r\n<p>Aperture, shutter speed, ISO and white balance are your indispensable tools and they will aid you to achieve a good exposure in your pictures. You&rsquo;ll find that it goes beyond than achieving that good exposure &ndash; these settings open a huge world of options, like depth of field and composition for example, and these options will enable you to convey a striking story.</p>\r\n<p>This might seem very intimidating. I wish it were as easy as grabbing the camera, some fantastic food and a few plates, vintage cutlery and colorful napkins and after a few shots you will finally have some good images to choose from. In my workshops I usually get a collective groan from my participants as they realize there is no way out but to conquer the beasts of aperture, shutter speed and co.. And I expect some of you might be groaning right about now too, but truth is, until you tackle the tools of the camera you&rsquo;ll find that your camera will be in control of you. The basic techniques will always guide and keep you on course.</p>\r\n<p>To create a photograph you need light. There are three camera settings that need to balance in order to get a proper exposure. Your goal in using these aspects is to find a good balance in light, depth of field and focus. While there are some principles to understand and follow, there is no set of rules or presets that you can use to always get a correct exposure.</p>\r\n<p>In a nutshell, the amount of light coming into a lens combined with the length of time a shutter stays open creates an exposure. Exposure is made up of three elements:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Aperture:</strong> is the element in the lens that allows light to pass through it and into the camera, ultimately reaching the sensor. You control two things with aperture: the amount of light coming into the lens and depth of field. To control the light you need to change the size of the aperture. A wide opening lets a lot of light in and at the smallest opening it lets very little light in.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> is the amount of time that the camera sensor is exposed (or opened) to light when a photograph is being taken. Think of the shutter as a door that opens and closes, allowing light from the aperture to actually expose the sensor and create the image. When we set the shutter speed we determine how long the shutter stays open. A fast shutter speed means that the shutter is open for only a brief period of time, allowing very little light to hit the sensor. With a fast shutter speed you can &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; action. When the shutter is opened for a longer period of time, it allows more light to reach the sensor. This will capture movement, if there is any, in the frame.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>ISO:</strong> measures how sensitive the sensor is to light. ISO numbers usually start at 100 and depending on your camera can go up to 6400 and even higher. The lower the number is, the less sensitive to light; the higher the number, the more sensitive to light. In a perfect shooting environment, the ideal setting is among the lowest options. Think of ISO as the little creative helper of aperture and shutter speed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>While aperture and shutter speed perform two completely different functions, they always work together.</p>\r\n<p>The image of the pear was taken on a November day at 5PM. I love late afternoon light and wanted to capture the essence of a moody late autumn day. There was not much light left to the day but using my tools I was able to capture the right atmosphere. I set my aperture to f/2.8 as I had very little light to work with and needed a larger lens opening. On the creative side of the image, I really wanted to focus and depict the beauty of the pear with its colors, which complemented the time of year. I knew I would be working with a long exposure for this shot so mounted the camera on the tripod and set the shutter so that it would be open for a longer time to allow more light to come in.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Details for the shot:</strong> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Shot taken at 5 PM in November</li>\r\n<li>Aperture: f/2.8 </li>\r\n<li>Shutter Speed: 1 sec </li>\r\n<li>ISO. 160 </li>\r\n<li>Focal length: 50mm </li>\r\n<li>Lens: Prime &ndash; 50mm 1.4 mm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In contrast to the shot above the image of the milk, egg shells and cream was taken at about 12:45. Midday usually brings in powerful light and to control it can be difficult. I had a lot of light pouring through into my studio windows and as I wanted to highlight all of the items with the main focus point on the egg shells I selected a medium aperture of f/7.1 and my shutter speed was set to 1/4sec.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Details for the shot:</strong> </p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Shot taken at 12:45 PM in January </li>\r\n<li>Aperture: f/7.1 </li>\r\n<li>Shutter Speed: 1/4 sec </li>\r\n<li>ISO. 160 </li>\r\n<li>Focal length: 50mm </li>\r\n<li>Lens: Prime &ndash; 50mm 1.4 mm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>It takes practice to make both elements work together and to generate the kind of images you envision. I would recommend practice using the respective modes on your camera. The Aperture Priority mode (A or AV on the camera) will allow you to set the aperture on your camera, while the camera adjusts the shutter speed to get you as close as possible to a good exposure. Shutter Priority (S on the camera) will adjust the aperture so you can test out the effect of different settings. Take a few days on each mode to really understand what each setting does, noting down what the camera uses as settings for the mode it controls. Once you feel confident enough &ndash; move over to the Manual mode (M on the camera). Here it is all up to you to control both, the shutter and the aperture. Refer to the notes you took and practice with your own settings.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Concept of Depth of Field</strong></p>\r\n<p>When it comes to food photography or tabletop photography your creative tool will predominantly be aperture. Unless you are shooting movement, like wine being poured into a glass, or maple syrup drizzling onto a stack of pancakes, shutter speed will take a back seat.</p>\r\n<p>Have you ever wondered how some photos seem to pop out of the screen? The main tools a food photographer uses from his toolbox is what is called, selective focus, bokeh, blur and depth of field. These are powerful and effective techniques which make a photograph creatively stronger.</p>\r\n<p>Depth of Field (DoF) in a photograph is a distance to the sharpest point in the photograph from the foreground. It describes how much of your image is actually in focus. The right level of depth of field will vary depending on the photographer&rsquo;s individual style and desired effect for a particular image. The depth of field in an image is determined by the aperture, the focal length and the distance between camera and subject.</p>\r\n<p>The smaller the aperture is (high f/stop), the deeper the depth of field will be in your image, while the larger the aperture is (small f/stop), the shallower your depth of field will become. Short focal length produces a deep DoF and as the distance from camera to subject grows, so does the depth of focus in your image.</p>\r\n<p>This is an important concept to keep in mind as in food photography using the different depths of fields is one of the most important concepts used by the photographer to create and tell a story.</p>\r\n<p>A photograph with a <strong>shallow depth of field</strong> shows specific items (the ones you are focusing on) in focus while the rest is blurred. If you want to make an item in the foreground really pop and direct the viewer&rsquo;s focus on the main subject of the frame while blurring the background using shallow depth of field will be your most powerful tool.</p>\r\n<p>In the image below of the quinoa breakfast I wanted to really pinpoint the focus on the colorful fruit in the bowl and the texture of the nuts, fruit and quinoa. However I still wanted the viewer to get the gist of the surrounding. So, to direct the attention to the ingredients in the bowl first and then take the viewers eyes to the rest of the set-up I used a very shallow DoF here. The rest of the items around the bowl are very out of focus and blurred. You will see that when you view this image your eyes automatically take in the part of the image that is in sharp focus. I use the spoon to then direct the eyes to the rest of the items in the image. Even though the handle of the spoon is blurred it serves the purpose of a guide directing the eyes further into the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In the diptych of the raspberry sorbet you can see the effects of how focusing on different points of the image works. Although both images are of the same subject, and the aperture for both is set to f/4.5, the image on the left pinpoints the focus on the spoon blurring the sorbet in the jar and everything around it. The image on the right on the other hand focuses on the sorbet in the jar and the spoon handle is the object that is blurred. Look at both the images again. Same subject but eachch one sends out a different message to the viewer evoking a different feeling.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>There are times when a <strong>medium DoF</strong> is preferable. This effect keeps the emphasis on the entire set-up or dish as a whole instead of pin pointing on only one element, maintaining a sense of balance, which is always very pleasing to the eye. A scene with a medium focus seems more natural as we do not usually see things in the real world with an extremely shallow or very deep DoF.</p>\r\n<p>In the image of the macaroons I was keen to capture the set-up as a whole. I wanted the viewer to get the idea of the making of these Lemon Pepper Macaroons and the individual elements needed to put the macaroons together. My aperture is set to f/5 with a focal length of 70mm and the focus lies on the macaroon in the front with the filling. The other items in the image are neither completely out of focus nor completely in focus. This keeps things balanced and inviting. The viewer sees the jar with the cream filling and the lemon curd and acknowledges the wooden spoon. In this way I hope to pull the viewer into my image and make them a part of the story I am telling.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand due to the nature of the image it might be necessary to keep everything nice and clear. For example ingredient shots or a dessert buffet, where no specific item or ingredient should be particularly highlighted but rather the entire set-up should tell a story.</p>\r\n<p>In the image below, I wanted not only to highlight the Puttanesca sauce in the pan but as the ingredients that make up the sauce are also very important I wanted the reader to take these into consideration as the image is observed. Here, I have set my aperture to f/8 and my focus lies just around the middle of the frame. The full view of a <strong>deeper DoF</strong> in this image gives the perfect effect to get the viewer to see all the elements needed to make the sauce.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Selective focus is a tool that should be used thoughtfully. It has a tendency to be over-used, resulting in images that often blur a bit too much of the information inside the photo. Think of what you are trying to say with your image.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Is it important for the viewer to see everything in the image?</li>\r\n<li>Is it important to direct the viewer&rsquo;s eye straight to the focal point and to an important element?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Be careful not to equate DoF only with the f/stop number you pick. While a very small f/stop will create a shallow depth of field, it can however, also ruin the effect by narrowing the focus point too much. If you use the right distance ratio with your subject you can achieve lovely DoF with high f/stops.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-24 16:52:15','2015-02-24 16:52:15'),(131,44,'Harnessing Natural Light for Food Images',NULL,'<p>Light, not a camera, is your primary tool. It is hands down the most important aspect of a photograph. The word photography actually means to draw with light. Lighting has the biggest visible impact on your food photos and is the most important element, which requires your full attention when capturing your image. It illuminates the subject, it glows through objects, it reflects off plates and cutlery and it creates shadows and highlights in selected areas.</p>\r\n<p>Of all the challenges facing food photographers, lighting is probably the most crucial and most important factor. Your light dictates everything about your photo. It influences not only the settings you choose, but the entire character of the photo itself.<br /><br />Whatever the source of your ambient light is there are a variety of ways you can capture, hone and apply it. The great thing about lighting food for still photography is that a basic, simple lighting setup will create incredible results. You really do not need fancy equipment or an elaborate lighting setup for your photographs. Often, just one type of light is required to beautifully light your motive.<br /><br />However, not all light fits the purpose of taking a good picture and not all light is good for photography. Light can be cold or hot, hard or soft, smooth or harsh. Understanding it and harnessing it to suit your needs is the key. As our eyes see light every day we tend to take it for granted. We do not pay attention to things like shadows, color, intensity or direction of light and we overlook things like harsh highlight, or unwanted shadows when using our cameras.</p>\r\n<p>My biggest realization as a photographer came to me when I actually started to see light. I would actually see how the light reflected off the vintage cutlery, or how it bathed the vegetables in a soft glow, or noticed the direction it was coming from and how it faded the edges of the shadows. <br /><br />The light you see in the middle of the day looks very different when compared to the cooler light you get later in the afternoon. The light coming from the fluorescent light bulb in your kitchen is not the same as the light coming from the light bulb on your desktop lamp. Knowing how to use the different types of light is what needs practice, because with the different light sources you can create different moods, atmospheres and intensities.<br /><br />I primarily shoot in natural lighting for many different reasons. Mainly because in my opinion natural light gives the shot a lovely ambient and atmosphere and the colors look vibrant and real.<br /><br />Being a self-taught photographer, it took me a lot of time and even more practice to understand how various lighting conditions effect my image. One does not need sunny, blue skies with bright light pouring through the windows. As a matter of fact as I evolved, I realized that cloudy, rainy days provide an awesome diffused light that give a wonderful atmosphere to an image. I also realized that natural light comes in many colors depending on the time of day or the type of day (overcast or sunny).</p>\r\n<p>Color temperatures are measured using the Kelvin scale. If your camera offers a Kelvin reading to adjust your white balance you might want to play around with it to practice and get familiar with it. Right now I just want to give you this much for this lesson: it&lsquo;s important to know that a high number on the Kelvin scale means a cool &ndash; blue &ndash; light, while the smaller number represents a warm light. <br /><br />Think of this to help you remember: from the early morning, around dawn, when the sun is coming out, the sky has a reddish tone it is about 2000K ; then as the sun comes out, the color temperature rises and the color becomes orange and warmer making the color temperature turn warmer too; then as the day progresses to late afternoon early evening, all that is left is the blueish tone in the sky.<br /><br />The reason I want you to know this is because it is important to imagine how the color temperature will effect the look of your images throughout the day. If you are taking shots in the morning you will have images that are &ldquo;warm&rdquo; meaning that they will have reddish-yellow hue, and as the day progresses into the late afternoon your images will be &ldquo;cool&rdquo; meaning that they will have a bluish hue. This should help you create the appropriate mood and atmosphere for your images.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>A few tips and things to keep in mind will help you learn how you can tame the light for your images.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Position your food close to a window, preferably facing North or East. The light that streams through should be indirect and diffused.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The best time of day to shoot is usually in the late afternoon, when the sunlight is diffused. The light is at its best then. But pay close attention to the strength and intensity of light you are getting. While bright early afternoon sun is lovely, it can be very harsh and strong, which will give you harsh shadows and bold highlights. &nbsp;You do not want harsh sun rays shinning in on your plate or set-up. If you do have light that is powerful you will want to soften it so that it works better for your image. You can use a diffuser or place any type of white translucent paper or fabric between the light source and your motive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The image of the cauliflower soup was taken on a very bright day. I had a lot of strong natural light coming into the studio. I wanted to use this light to translate it into a crisp and clear image of the cauliflower soup with minimal shadows. To achieve the look I diffused the light coming through the windows with white translucent fabric that covered the entire length and height of my windows. Using reflectors on the left and in the front of the set-up I bounced the light back reducing the shadows and dark patches in that area.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Identify different areas around your house or studio that offer the best quality of light at different times of the day. You might be running around with food throughout the whole house/studio, but if you can get that one good shot with perfect lighting it will be worth it.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The distance and location of the light in relation to your motive will play the biggest part in determining the softness or harshness of the light. <strong><em>The basic principle to remember is that the bigger and closer the light is to your subject, the softer the light is.</em></strong> This is an extremely important concept to remember so that you can manipulate the light in your image to give you the different moods or looks required. If you want very soft light with minimal shadows (like the image of the cauliflower soup) you&lsquo;ll want to diffuse the light and get it as close to your motive as possible. But if you want a moody shot with intense shadows you will want to move the light (or your set-up) farther away from your subject.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In the ingredient shot my aim was to create a slightly more atmospheric shot and I wanted the shadows to give it a moodier feel. The light is from the right side of the frame and I moved the entire set-up further away from the windows so that the light could cast some nice shadows around some of the ingredients. I still used a smaller reflector on the left side of the frame to reduce the harsh highlights.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When it comes to the color of light, make sure you use only one type of light in your photo. If you are using natural light but have another light nearby that might interfere with your set-up you might get some strange colors going on in your final image. It might be hard to correct.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Angles of Light</strong><br />When referring to the direction of light one often uses the terms of the clock system. Imagine that your set is a clock face and the camera is at 6 o&rsquo;clock so we can then easily refer to the different positions or angles of lighting from this point.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Backlighting</em></strong>, light that is placed directly behind the motive is coming from 12 o&rsquo;clock and <strong><em>side lighting</em></strong> would then be either 3 or 9 o&rsquo;clock, depending on whether the light is coming from the right or left side of your motive.</p>\r\n<p>One should avoid placing the light source directly at 6 o&rsquo;clock as this creates an extremely flat light making your images look less flattering!<br /><br />I personally prefer backlighting &ndash; light that is positioned at 12 o&rsquo;clock or slightly angled at 10/11 or 1/2 o&rsquo;clock. Backlighting adds more texture and depth to an image. It brushes the surface of the food and brightens up certain food items making them look vibrant.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The image of the Christmas fruitcake depicts the effect of backlighting fantastically. You can see how the light reflects and hits off the various surfaces in the image creating a play of sparkly light and soft shadows. It highlights the story I want to tell: Christmas time and the table is set festively ready for the gusts to arrive. There are glittery baubles and decorations on the table and the entire look for this image is crisp, bright and white. <br /><br />On the other hand side lighting gives you wonderful shadows and will create a dramatic look and moody atmospheres.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The image of the Saffron Mango Kulfi popsicles has the light coming in from between 2 and 3 o&rsquo;clock. I wanted a dramatic and artistic look for this image. These were Indian desserts served in the typical American popsicle form and I wanted to give the dessert a totally new look. Covering part of my window with some black card I reduced the amount of light coming into the frame. I wanted the dark shadows in the left corner so I did not bounce the light there. The ice cubes in that corner reflects some light back onto the popsicles, which was sufficient.  </p>\r\n<p>It basically depends on what type of photo you want to take and what kind of mood you want to evoke. If you are in a rut - my advice, simply reposition your light angle or your food. It is a super easy way to change and shake things up a bit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lighting Equipment</strong><br />There are a few additional pieces of equipment that you will need to complement and help you light up your images in areas where required. Food photography in this respect is very easy to keep things simple and one does not need to spend huge amounts of money on these pieces of equipment. As a matter of fact you can easily make them yourself.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Bounce or Reflector</strong> &nbsp;&ndash; this is the cheapest piece of equipment you can own which will make a huge impact on your photos. Simple white card in different sizes serves the purpose of a bounce brilliantly.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A bounce is used to &bdquo;bounce&ldquo; light back into your set-up/motive, which helps to gently illuminate darker patches and areas. Basically, it is positioned on the other side of your light source. So, if your main light comes from the right then place the reflector on the left of your food.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep in mind:</strong> the same rule applies here too &ndash; the closer your reflector is to the your subject, the brighter it will be, and the larger your reflector is the softer the light will be.   You can also use gold or silver colored card a reflectors. Remember however that each color you use will give your image a different look.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>In the images of the Easter bread above I have used 2 different colored reflectors. The image on the left is using a normal white colored reflector while the image on the right is taken using a gold colored reflector. As you can see, the one on the right has a golden glow to it, which is what I was looking for. My story here was an Easter morning breakfast with freshly baked Easter bread. As early mornings tend to have that lovely warm golden glow I wanted to replicate it in my image.&nbsp; The image was shot during mid-afternoon so the gold reflector gave me the early morning look and glow I wanted.   </p>\r\n<p>If you had to choose only one accessory to use when photographing food, I would 100% recommend a reflector (or two / three).</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Scrims or diffusers</strong> &ndash; is another very inexpensive do-it-yourself piece of equipment. It can be anything from a thin sheet of white cloth or translucent artists&rsquo; vellum.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>A scrim helps to soften and diffuse harsh light when passed through it. It is placed between the light source and the food.</p>',17,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-24 16:57:23','2015-02-24 16:57:23'),(132,44,'Get the Look: Color and Texture',NULL,'<p>We are captivated with bright colors and when we view a photograph our eyes will automatically be directed to the brightest part first, before our eyes maneuver through the rest of the image. As a food photographer and stylist you need to keep this in mind when you create your scene. You will have the main subject that you want to highlight, so it is important to set up your frame so that your viewer&rsquo;s eyes are directed straight to the food, which is the main star of the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s important to analyze color and texture of not only the food but of the entire set-up. Color and texture are two important aspects of photography as both play vital roles on a few levels.</p>\r\n<p>For example, the texture of the ingredients you use and the way you set them up will have an effect on the way the light hits, reflects and bounces off each item. In the same way, light will play the same game with the props you use. Glossy and shiny plates or backgrounds will create more of a glare in comparison to matte colored pieces that provide a more subdued look.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In the picture of the Salmon Kedgeree the ingredients of the red peppers, orange pumpkin, pink salmon and the vivid yellow of the quail eggs provide a fantastic rainbow of colors. The rest of the styling is kept in mostly whites and the blues without being too intrusive. The eyes fall first on the yellow yolks of the eggs and then take in the rest of the colors around the subject. <br /><br />Use color thoughtfully and in moderation. Too many color themes will overkill the image, making the photograph look cheesy and taking away the attention from the main motive &ndash; the food. And it will often be the color and tones of the food or ingredients that will guide you to select a color scheme for your photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>In the image of the colorful tomatoes in the blue berry picker works harmonious because I use the different colors of the tomatoes to guide me with my props. The colors of the yellow, orange and red tomatoes can be found again in the striped napkin and the blue of the berry picker is highlighted in the blue stripe in the front, creating a pleasing border for the eye. <br /><br />Start by analyzing the color and color combinations of your food, then select the background, pick out the bowls/plates and napkins accordingly. There is a lot of potential and room for creativity as you can play around with complementary colors or keep the colors tone in tone, using different shades of the same color, or use analogous colors.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In the image of the blackberry apple crostada I stayed with the earthy tones of brown to accentuate the rustic dish, while the white of the cream breaks up any monotony. <br /><br />If you find you are stuck picking the right color, use a color wheel to identify complementary colors or to visualize different hues within a color group. If you find your food image looks unbalanced, using contrasting colors, with one dominant color will usually put it back in equilibrium.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Tip: I usually collect my favorite color combinations on my <strong><a href=\"http://pinterest.com/meetawflh/colors-palettes/\">Pinterest Board &ldquo;Colors and Palettes&rdquo;</a></strong>. <br /><br /><strong>Use your background like you would a canvas and start painting.</strong></p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}<strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>Texture is the thing that gives a food shot a &bdquo;feel&ldquo; or body. If it is done well it will be the texture of food on display in a shot that will make you want to reach out and touch it, feel it and taste it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>A simple example would be soup. Pour it in a bowl and shoot it. You&lsquo;ll see it might look a little flat, maybe boring. If you are trying to convey a more drool-worthy message &ndash; you might consider showing it&lsquo;s thickness by placing a few golden toasted croutons on the top. Add a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle some parsley. By now you should have the viewer feeling and tasting the texture of each element.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>In the beet parsnip soup I use slices of apples and hazelnuts to create layers to give the light coming in from the back different surfaces to highlight and drop shadows. This gives the soup an almost 3D feel. The toppings on the soup also send a vital message to the viewer: it says &ldquo;I am thick and creamy and ready for you to dip your spoon in!&rdquo; In terms of colors I have kept things very simple: white and have mainly used hues of purple to keeping in tone with the color of the soup. <br /><br />The most important advice I can give, however, is while you are experimenting and trying to find the right look for your food images, make sure you stay true to your style and have fun discovering your own versatility. It&rsquo;s not important to create perfectly styled images right from the beginning. What is more important is taking the time to learn the techniques and finding out what works for you.<br /><br />Eventually, you will develop a sense of your own style (if you have not already). You might even develop many different styles.</p>',17,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-24 17:40:16','2015-02-24 17:40:16'),(133,44,'Setup, Styling and Perfect Focus',NULL,'<p>Focus is such a fundamental aspect of good photo taking. A photo out of focus or one that has no primary point of center or interest will be extremely frustrating to the viewer. <br />So, one of the first things one should really practice is getting the food captured with a sharp focus. You&lsquo;ll need to understand and learn how your camera does that. And this is what we&rsquo;ll be doing in this lesson. <br /><br />There&lsquo;s a lot you can do with focus to enhance a photo even further. Not only during the composition of the set-up but also learning how to highlight just parts of the food and blurring out the rest will allow you more creativity with your images.<br /><br />Focus is a very important and fundamental element in photography, yet with food photography it can be very tricky to know exactly where to focus your lens. So, before you start composing, determine which one element or elements will be your point of interest. The scene you set needs to help a viewer understand your message and not have the viewpoint jumbled with no primary focal point. <br /><br />This point becomes even more important to comprehend when you want to use a shallow depth of field, where much of the focus might be blurred and the spot that is in focus will stand out even more.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In the image of the chestnuts I found a few gorgeous slightly violet tinted chestnuts in the bag and decided to select one to be my main point of focus. I used a shallow depth of field to really highlight the single chestnut by pin pointing the focus on it and putting the other chestnuts below slightly out of focus. The viewer sees the other items but does not need to have each chestnut in clear focus to get the message in this image. <br /><br />It can be a challenge to decide exactly where to put the focus point in your image. A rough guideline to help you find not only your focus but also aid with placement is the rule of the thirds. <br /><br /><strong>Rule of the thirds</strong> principle asks you to mentally divide your image into thirds (both horizontally and vertically) like a tic-tac-toe board, so that you have 9 parts.<br />With this grid in mind the &lsquo;rule of thirds&rsquo; now identifies four important parts of the image that you should consider placing points of interest in as you frame your image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>It also gives you four &lsquo;sections&rsquo; (marked in red in the picture) that are also useful positions for elements in your photo. <br /><br />The purpose of the rule is to help you achieve lines and placements of objects that are naturally pleasing to the human eye by giving the photo a more balanced appeal. Some subjects will be trickier than others, so my advice is if you seem to get stuck, try to move things around and find a few different placements. Have a look at the images and see which of the photos has the best focus point. <br /><br />Do not get bogged down with the too many rules, free your mind and allow your intuition to find the best balance. The rule of the thirds offers a great start to practice or to find your way back if you get stuck, but free yourself from strict rules and allow yourself to have fun because only then will you be able to see other interesting angles and placements. <br /><br />Basically, if your eyes are drawn to a certain point on the image you are viewing &ndash; that&rsquo;s most probably where the focus should be. <br /><br />Another tip is to focus on an item in the photo that is close to you, as opposed to far away or in the middle of the dish. However, if you have a set-up that has many elements in it and you want to describe the entire scene with one single shot it is a good idea to select a focus point toward the middle so that more than one specific item is included.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In the image of the Advocaat Cream the flat surface of the white creams was proving to be rather complex to find the perfect point of focus. I placed the cinnamon stars on top and used this as my specific point of focus. In the same way you can use garnishes or a particular ingredient to point your focus to. Furthermore, as there are many items in my frame I chose to focus on the one bowl in the front as the eyes naturally fall on this first.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>In the breakfast image, once again there are many items in my shot and while I wanted the viewer to take in the entire scene, I pinpointed my point of focus on the croissant and selected a medium depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>In the asparagus image I was looking to shoot the lovely fresh vegetable which was my main ingredient for a dish. While I wanted to have the entire bunch in my shot I planned to highlight the tips. Being the most valuable part of the vegetable, it was easy to decide where the focus point would be. I focused on the asparagus tips towards the back of the bunch and blurred the stems as the color and volume take up a larger part of the image. However, while the viewer register the stems and the color, the eyes are directed instantly towards the tips that are in focus.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-24 17:46:06','2015-02-24 17:46:06'),(134,44,'Angles, Placement and Composition',NULL,'<p>For beautiful food photography, you need more than just knowledge about your camera and what setting to use. Having a good understanding of how the images are composed is an extremely useful skill and sometimes is more important than those technical aspects of photography we have been covering in the past few lessons. <br /><br />By learning these compositional elements you will be able to use them effectively together to help you create great food photographs.<br /><br />Although there are no hard rules when it comes to photographing food as a whole, there are however, standard techniques that can be applied to a photograph to make it more appealing. I always look for balance in my images when I photograph food and using techniques like placement of the items within the frame or finding the right angle to convey the message are a few of the elements I think about when I begin composing my scene.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Placement</strong><br />When does one start thinking about composing, styling and selecting the right angle for a shot?</p>\r\n<p>Before you actually physically begin to set-up your shot you need to decide what message, mood, emotion you want to convey. Think about the direction of light and the shadows that will highlight your image. Once you begin to create the set-up one of the first things you will consider is how to compose your shot. You need to think about where to place the dish within the frame. Do you want the dish to be centered or off-center in the final shot?<br /><br />Truth be told this is entirely a creative decision that you take as a photographer and as a stylist. &nbsp;Sometimes finding the best placement or angle from which to photograph your motive can make a big impact on the look and feel of the image. <br /><br />If you are used to photographing in one particular direction or in one particular position or angle, shake things up a little and simply change the point of interest. <br /><br />Sometimes placing a subject off center or shooting it from a different angle allows you to convey a more artistic expression. This can give your photographs more visual weight and a different creative emphasis. Often one will not need many props or colors to achieve an eye-catching image &ndash; sometimes simply moving the dish to the right or the left of the frame can help to break the monotony.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Of course you can crop an image to make it look off center but I often find that one can add more movement or be more creative when one styles the image from the beginning to look as if it has been cropped. All one needs to do is take a step back and view the set-up from a different point of view &ndash; and start moving things around to create more interest in the composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>At the same time do keep in mind that sometimes there is great value in centering your motive to emphasize their beauty. By centering the motive the viewer gets a very clear idea of what the main subject of the image is. If the composition has other props, foods where the main motive is part of a larger setting &ndash; centering the main object will direct the viewer&rsquo;s eyes to it. <br /><br />So, if you are composing a shot that includes a main element with supplemental ingredients or dishes, the best way to go about this is to place the main element in the center with the sides slightly off-center to make the viewers point of focus fall clearly on the main item. <br /><br /><strong>Angles</strong><br />It is easy to add more interest to your composition with minimal effort by simply exploring new viewpoints from which to shoot. Interesting angles keep things fresh and provide your viewer a refreshing or unique way of seeing something familiar. <br /><br />Observe texture, shape, height, width, shadows from all sides of your subject.</p>\r\n<p>I use a tripod almost 90% of the time and I move around the table a lot or move the subject to find the best angle. I shoot a few images from each angle that speaks to me and then I will view them on the computer sometimes making notes for those I particularly like. <br /><br />There are different angles that one can use to shoot your motive. In my opinion however I think there are 3 that work really well for plated food. <br /><br /><strong>Eye level</strong><br />For those of you who are still at the starting phase of food photography shooting from an eye-level position seems to be the most natural choice. This angle allows you to confine the subject in front of your eyes and works best if you are shooting a motive with height or tall food items. When shooting beverages coming down eye-to-eye with the drink helps to showcase the height of the glass.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Overhead / High View Point</strong><br />Overhead is a great angle if you want to show a lot of things at once, like an ingredient shot or a table setting scene. But remember it does not work for every kind of shot as this angle tends to minimize strong elements by putting textures and heights on a more level plane. However, this perspective lets you show other dimensions and provides new options for DoF. You can focus on the top of the dish and use a shallow depth of field blurring the other items underneath &ndash; this gives a powerful image. Another reason I like to use this shot is that it can minimize height issues if I need to get a variety of elements in one shot and if the space I am working in is limited for a shot sing the other angles.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Three Quarters</strong><br />This is my favorite angle &ndash; as it is a very pleasing one for food &ndash; it&rsquo;s similar to looking down at food from the same angle you would if you we sitting at a table and were about tot eat it. I use it quite often as it showcases the food really well. This angle is not only advisable but necessary to use when you want to take an image with food or ingredients inside a bowl or for any kind of dish that has depth as you want to make sure that the food is visible. &nbsp;By partially looking down on the dish you can see it clearly.&nbsp; In my opinion it brings the best of both the other angles into a shot. This angle works very well with most focal lengths and a shallow DoF can be portrayed very artistically, which is probably why I really like this angle.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Make sure you pay close attention to the background and foreground when you compose your food photographs. Even though there are items featured in the back or are not in focus with the frame can still have a critical impact and send a meaningful message to the viewer. So, it is important that the not only look good but also are placed strategically to balance and please the viewer&rsquo;s eyes.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Horizontal or Vertical Orientation</strong><br />In my workshops I often get asked whether I prefer the vertical or horizontal format to shoot my images. While there are absolutely no set rules here, I personally find that for food photography a vertical orientation offers a lot of room to play around with. There is a lot of space in the back to build depth and it allows you play around with DoF. It will also depend on what the purpose of the shot is and what you subject you are shooting. If you are shooting for your blog, most templates work best when vertical images are featured. The same applies to magazine and cookbook (unless it&rsquo;s a double paged image). Furthermore, if you are shooting subject with height, like bottles or cocktails a vertical orientation will work well but if you are photographing something wide then a horizontal orientation will be the way to go.</p>',16,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-02-24 17:49:56','2015-02-24 17:49:56'),(135,44,'Props and Go for It!',NULL,'<p>Before you go diving into overly styled or overly propped images make sure you know everything you need to about each individual element of photography, like lighting, how to focus, using color and texture to enhance you images - pretty much what we have been focusing on the past lessons.

The answer is, quite honestly, that I can&rsquo;t, at least not on my own.</p>\r\n<p>What I can do is give you some general guidelines, point out certain elements that make some images more powerful than others, and share with you how others have created scenes that evoke emotion and tell stories.

Ask any of them what they were trying to capture in their photo and they will be able to tell you without hesitation. This is the advantage of shooting with intention.</p>\r\n<p>Shooting with intention means setting forth with a purpose and not just shooting willy nilly in the hopes that something will turn out to be a good photo.

The first is the <em>Elements of Visual Arts</em>, which are the building blocks, and the second is the <em>Principles of Art</em>, which are how those building blocks are arranged.<br /><br /><strong>Visual Arts</strong> - Arts that are visual in nature, like painting, sculpture, design, etc.&nbsp; Photography is another form of visual art.&nbsp; What will help us to understand the rules of composition is understanding the building blocks of visual arts.&nbsp; Many people might not think about this fundamental connection, but it&rsquo;ll all start to make sense over the next section. <br /><br /><strong>Elements of Visual Art &amp; Design:<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>These are the building blocks of every piece of visual art:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Line </strong><br /><strong>2. Shape </strong><br /><strong>3. Form </strong><br /><strong>4. Texture</strong><br /><strong>5. Tone / Value</strong><br /><strong>6. Space</strong><br /><strong>7. Color / Hue</strong><br /><br />Let&rsquo;s go through them really quickly:<br /><br /><strong>1. Line</strong> - A line is just a mark on a canvas.&nbsp; It has thickness, direction, and length.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Shape</strong> - Shapes are 2-dimensional.&nbsp; They can be either geometric or organic.&nbsp; Geometric shapes are typically man-made and organic shapes occur in the natural world.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br /><br /><strong>3. Form</strong> - Forms are 3-dimensional; they have height, width, &amp; depth.&nbsp; When trying to tell the difference between a shape and a form, remember that forms are something you would be able to walk around if they existed in real life.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Texture</strong> - Texture is essentially how something looks like it would feel if you could touch it: smooth, rough, etc.&nbsp; In the following painting by Monet, you can practically feel the rocks under your fingers just looking at it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}<br /><br /><strong>5. Tone / Value</strong> - The tone or value refers to the lightness or darkness of an object.&nbsp; Light and shadow play a huge role in this painting by Friant.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}<br /><br /><strong>6. Space</strong> - Space can be positive or negative.&nbsp; Positive space refers to where the object is and negative refers to where the object is not.&nbsp; Negative space was a feature characteristic of many classical Chinese paintings, such as the one seen here.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<br /><br /><strong>7. Color / Hue</strong> - The color and hue help to convey atmosphere and mood.&nbsp; The painter Salvador Dali (as evident in the image below) typically used vibrant colors to enliven the scenes he painted.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}<br /><br /><strong>Principles of Art:</strong></p>\r\n<p>We just covered the <em>Elements of Visual Art</em>, which are the building blocks of art. Now that we know what the building blocks are.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk about how they are arranged and composed. These things make up the <em>Principles of Art</em>:<br /><br />1. Emphasis <br />2. Lines <br />3. Patterns <br />4. Rhythm / Movement <br />5. Balance <br />6. Unity <br />7. Perspective <br />8. Proportion / Scale <br />9. Lighting<br />10. Contrast <br />11. Crop<br />12. Negative Space<br />13. Geometry<br /><br /><strong>1. Emphasis</strong> - As an artist, you are able to control where a viewer&rsquo;s eye lands. This is the created center of interest, or the point of emphasis in an image.&nbsp; In this painting by Munch (below), the emphasis is placed on the subject&rsquo;s face, with viewers&rsquo; eyes going either: a) straight to the face or b) to the sky and then following the natural line straight down to the face.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}<br /><br /><strong>2. Lines</strong> - Strong lines pull viewers into the image.&nbsp; In this following painting by Grimshaw, the lines from the path make it feel as though you can just step right into the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}<br /><br /><strong>3. Patterns</strong> - A pattern is a repeated design that helps to establish a visual beat within an image. Patterns tend invoke feelings of harmony and rhythm, which is attractive to the human eye.&nbsp; Patterns can be natural or manmade, regular or irregular, and involve shapes and colors.&nbsp; The repeating column pattern in this painting below by Robert lead the viewer&rsquo;s eye into the image and create an desirable feeling of orderliness despite the destruction of the surroundings.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}<br /><br /><strong>4. Rhythm / Movement</strong> - Including elements that flow suggests motion within the image.&nbsp; The blowing fabric and hair in the Botticelli painting below make the viewer feel like there&rsquo;s a breeze blowing and that the subjects are moving in the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Balance</strong> - Careful placement of elements within a frame ensure that there&rsquo;s a sense of stability and equilibrium.&nbsp; There are 3 different types of balance:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Symmetrical - when elements are mirrored</li>\r\n<li>Asymmetrical - when elements are not mirrored, but still hold equal weight</li>\r\n<li>Radial - when elements radiate out from the center</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>This painting by Van Gogh below shows a blend of asymmetrical and radial balance.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}<br /><br /><strong>6. Unity</strong> - Unity is the feeling of having all parts of the image in harmony, giving the image a sense of completion, wholeness, and oneness.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to put this feeling into words, but sometimes when it feels good, you just know. Obviously, this can be a rather subjective feeling, but the following painting by Renoir feels pretty harmonious to me.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}<br /><br /><strong>7. Perspective</strong> - How is eye positioned in relation to the objects?&nbsp; Viewing subjects from above versus below conveys different emotions. For example, looking up at a subject tends to make the subject look more powerful and domineering, as seen in this following painting by Titian. Looking down at a subject can infantilize them or make them look weak in relation to you as the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment14}<br /><br /><strong>8. Proportion / Scale</strong> - An artist must be conscious of the size of their subject, in relation to not just the canvas, but to other objects, and even to itself.&nbsp; Da Vinci&rsquo;s Vitruvian Man is said to show the perfect proportions of the human body.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}<br /><br /><strong>9. Lighting</strong> - For the most part, artist are able to take control and determine what is lit vs. left in shadow in an image.&nbsp; The directionality of light helps to define shapes and accentuate textures.&nbsp; The thing that the artist Rembrandt became best known for was his use of light and directionality, shown in this painting here. To this day, &ldquo;Rembrandt Lighting&rdquo; is regarded to be one of the most flattering forms of portrait lighting.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}<br /><br /><strong>10. Contrast</strong> - Some contrast may be necessary to create a sense of unity in an image. Contrast can be provided through the use of elements in conflict within an image, such as light / dark, good / evil, etc., some of which can be seen in this painting by Titian.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment17}<br /><br /><strong>11. Crop</strong> - What is the field of view given to the viewer? How much of a scene is the artist choosing to share with the audience?&nbsp; For example, the painter Vermeer could have chosen to include the milkmaid&rsquo;s feet or to crop closer in on her hands, in his work below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment18}<br /><br /><strong>12. Negative Space</strong> - What you leave out is just as important as what you include.&nbsp; Magritte experimented with the idea of using negative space to frame his subjects, in the example below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment19}<br /><br /><strong>13. Geometry</strong> - An entire class can be taught on how math influences art, but for this course, I just want to touch upon the <em>Golden Mean</em>.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment20}<br /><br /><strong>Golden Mean</strong> - There are a number of terms that refer to essentially the same idea: <em>Golden Ratio</em>, <em>Golden Spiral</em>, <em>Divine Proportion</em>, <em>Golden Proportion</em>, <em>Fibonacci&rsquo;s Number</em>, etc. What these terms are referencing is the <em>Golden Ratio</em>, which is the ratio of the long edge to the short edge of an image or structure. That ratio = 1:1.618.&nbsp; This ratio has been found in art, architecture, and nature for generations and is pleasing to the human eye for unknown reasons. There are, however, people who question the existence of the Golden Mean and actual use of \"ratio\" in paintings is debatable.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll touch upon the overlay in the next slide, but have a quick look at the next few images to see how the Golden Spiral relates to the Greek Parthenon and to Da Vinci&rsquo;s Mona Lisa.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment21}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment22}<br /><br />This is how the ratio and the spiral came to be: Take any rectangle and draw a single line inside it to make a square. In the remaining rectangle, do the same, and continue to do that ad infinitum. Then, start in the farthest corner and draw an arc through each of the corners, again ad infinitum. The resulting spiral you see is the <em>Golden Spiral.</em>{<br /><br />{attachment23}<br /><br />The idea is that in more compelling images, the important elements of an image tend be placed at the eye of the spiral or along the arc.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment24}<br /><br />Can you imagine where the eye of the spiral would be in this image?</p>\r\n<p>{attachment25}<br /><br />This spiral is found in nature, as seen in this stock image..</p>\r\n<p>{attachment26}<br /><br />And in design. This image was sourced from Berlin &amp; Mauer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment27}<br /><br />If you work in <em>Adobe Lightroom</em> and decide that you want to crop your images to fit within the Golden Spiral, there exists a crop overlay tool that shows you the spiral as you crop. Just hit the O key to toggle between overlays when you have the crop tool selected (Shift + O rotates the spiral).&nbsp; The following example was sourced from holycrop.wordpress.com<br /><br />{attachment28}<br /><br />Well that&rsquo;s it for the first lesson.<br /><br />Now, on to the assignment!</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-11 17:25:56','2015-03-11 18:35:37'),(137,45,'Rules of Composition (Part 1 of 2)',NULL,'<p>At the beginning of our first lesson, I talked about the importance of shooting with intention and being able to think critically about our own images.<br /><br />I went over the Elements of Visual Art &amp; Design (the building blocks of every piece of visual art) and the Principles of Art (how those elements are arranged and composed).<br /><br />These elements and principles are important to become familiar with because they provide us with some of the terminology we need to be able to discuss and analyze our work. <br /><br />In this lesson, we&rsquo;ll learn about the <em>Rules of Composition</em> as they relate to photography specifically. <br /><br />As we go through the rules, you&rsquo;ll start to notice some overlap between the rules, as well as with those Principles of Art we went over in our first lesson. <br /><br />With each rule, I&rsquo;ll provide images to illustrate that rule at work. When applicable, I&rsquo;ll also share photographs that demonstrate how the rules can be successfully broken (what good is a rule if it can&rsquo;t be broken, right?). Pay careful attention to the two potentially different types of examples I&rsquo;ll be sharing for each rule.<br /><br />One important thing to realize is that there&rsquo;s no comprehensive list of rules when it comes to composition. I&rsquo;ve pulled together a bunch that I know and have heard of over the years. By the end of my list, you&rsquo;ll see that they become less like rules and more like tips for things to think about while you&rsquo;re composing. You&rsquo;ll also notice that there&rsquo;s a lot of overlap between rules and that there&rsquo;s often no having one without the other.<br /><br /><strong>Rules of Composition (a.k.a. How to make your photos more interesting):</strong><br /><br /><strong>1. Rule of Thirds</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>With your imagination, divide your image into thirds horizontally and vertically. Place important elements at the intersection of those lines or along the lines themselves.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This rule is closely related to the Golden Spiral. As you&rsquo;ll notice, the intersections of the lines falls at the tight whorl of the Golden Spiral. As we learned in Lesson 1, placing your subject on the tightest part of the whorl is more aesthetically pleasing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Place your horizon on or near the lines, and your subject at an intersection.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment1}<br /><br />This diagram shows how the Rule of Thirds (in pink) and The Golden Spiral (in green) are very closely related.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br /><br />Example of an image where the horizon falls on approximately the bottom third.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br /><br />The Rule of Thirds being broken, but still resulting in a powerful image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Avoid exact bisections of the frame</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Images are more dynamic when the strong lines present within the image do not fall directly on the midline. To refer back to the first rule I mentioned, the Rule of Thirds, consider placing your horizons closer to the top or bottom third of your image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The following scene is far more dynamic with the horizon line higher in the frame, allowing the viewer to feel like there&rsquo;s room to travel into the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes, however, an exact mid-image split works well - as in the image that follows.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Don&rsquo;t center your subject</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Off-center placement of a subject pushes it to the thirds (making it perfectly fit the Rule of Thirds) and thus makes for a more pleasing image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment7}<br /><br />Centering, however, isn&rsquo;t always bad.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Look for leading/converging lines</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Look for leading/converging&nbsp; lines as you&rsquo;re composing. These can be naturally found within your environment or implied by elements within the photo.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The lines give your photo direction and help to draw your viewer in, making the image more engaging.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The lines all point to the most important part of this photo, the woman with the child.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}<br /><br />These lines draw you into the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Include a vanishing point</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The vanishing point is the point in the distance towards which two receding lines are traveling. As the lines travel into the image, it appears as though they will meet at some point in the future. That implied meeting point is the vanishing point.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>You can&rsquo;t have a vanishing point without leading lines.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Use diagonal lines to make your image more interesting</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Horizontal lines = static &amp; calmvertical lines = permanence &amp; stability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Vertical lines = permanence &amp; stability</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Diagonal lines provide depth, create tension within an image, and help to lead the viewer&rsquo;s eye into the frame.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To emphasize the diagonals, shift your position or focal length.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment14}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Face the subject into the frame (Rule of Space)</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The viewer&rsquo;s eye will follow the direction of the subject&rsquo;s eyes and will explore elements within that area before moving on.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Having the subject look into the larger part of the frame allows space for the subject to move into. Not leaving that space for the subject to move can be uncomfortable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment15}<br /><br />Below is an example of this rule being broken and being even better because of it. The added tension of the woman looking out of the frame makes this photo. Photo by John Powell.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>8. Place something of interest in the foreground</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This is particularly important in landscape photography because it provides a sense of scale, as well as a way for viewer&rsquo;s eye to travel throughout the image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Having a foreground subject also creates layers within your image, making it more dynamic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment17}</p>\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no foreground subject here to provide scale, but the landscape is layered and still feels immense.<br /><br />{attachment18}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>9. Be mindful of your background</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ask yourself: How much does the background matter to the story you&rsquo;re telling? Carefully choose your aperture and focal length accordingly. If the background is less important, opt for a shallower depth of field and tighter composition. If the background helps to tell the story, opt for a deeper depth of field and wider composition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be careful for awkward backgrounds like telephone poles sticking straight out of people&rsquo;s heads or mysterious third limbs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t forget to change your own shooting position slightly to get your desired background. So many compositional no-nos could be avoided if the photographer just took one step to his or her left or right.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The background really makes this street scene come together.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment19}<br /><br />Shooting at a wide aperture makes your depth of field shallower, thus eliminating distracting background elements.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment20}<br /><br />It&rsquo;s good to avoid having background elements sticking out of people&rsquo;s bodies in strange ways, but sometimes this can be done creatively. Photo by Devin Castro.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment21}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>10. Be conscious of the brightest parts of your image</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The viewer&rsquo;s eyes are automatically drawn to the brightest part of an image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Cross-Eyed Test - it sounds ridiculous, but sometimes it&rsquo;s actually hard to figure out what the brightest part of your image is because the image itself is too distracting. One trick that I use is something I call the Cross-Eyed Test. Look at an image and cross your eyes ever so slightly for just a second as you&rsquo;re looking at the photo. More often than not, your eyes will go straight to the brightest part of the image. If that bright spot isn&rsquo;t the element you want your viewer to see first then you might want to rethink your framing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The light is, in essence, the subject of this photo, so it&rsquo;s fitting to allow the viewer&rsquo;s eye to be drawn there first.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment22}<br /><br />The lines of the airplane wing lead straight to the brightest spot, an example of multiple compositional elements working in tandem.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment23}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>11. Look for colors</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Bold, bright colors attract attention and can provide a &ldquo;pop&rdquo; to your photo.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Choose wisely and fill your frame with colors that will create a pleasing palate throughout your image. Be aware of complementary and contrasting colors.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment24}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment25}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>12. Simplify the scene</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Ask yourself: What is it that you want the viewer to see? If you can&rsquo;t answer this, the viewer won&rsquo;t be able to either, and your photograph won&rsquo;t have the impact you desire. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be a complex answer; the answer can be simple, as long as you have an answer you stand firmly behind.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A photographer friend of mine devised what he calls the Toddler Test. The test is meant to help determine whether the subject of an image is clear enough and works whether or not you have a toddler at your disposal. If you&rsquo;re near a toddler, ask the toddler, and if not, just ask yourself what a toddler would say. Ask the question, &ldquo;What is this a photo of?&rdquo; Say, for instance, your photo is a portrait of a beautiful woman in front of a wall of flowers. If they kid answers that the photos is of flowers instead of the woman, you may want to compose differently or simplify the scene a bit to emphasize the proper subject.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I hope a toddler would say this is a photo of flowers.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment26}</p>\r\n<p>This abstract image might be difficult in the toddler test, but it shows a scene distilled down to its most basic elements - just line, light, and shadow.<br /><br />{attachment27}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>13. Fill the frame</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to allow your subject to fill your entire frame. It&rsquo;s a bold choice and gives the viewer no room to question what he or she should be looking at.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment28}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment29}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment30}</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, minimizing your subject in the frame can still be effective. In this case, making the people on the horizon so small that it actually almost even changes your subject from them to the sunset and sky itself. The resulting image is powerful.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment31}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>14. Rule of Odds</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>For some unknown reason, having an odd number of objects in your image is more interesting than having even numbers. Opt instead for 1 or 3 items instead of 2 or 4.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>One possible explanation for why odds work better than evens is that even numbers imply symmetry, which throws the viewer off if the image is not actually symmetrical.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment32}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>15. Make sure the gaps between subjects is not uniform</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Varying the distance between subjects makes the relationships between the subjects feel more dynamic.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment33}<br /><br />Depending on what you&rsquo;re trying to achieve with an image, uniform spacing can also be effective.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment34}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p>Okay, we&rsquo;ve crossed the halfway point in terms of the rules that I want to cover. Because it&rsquo;s a lot of concepts to try to remember all at once, I&rsquo;d like to stop here and proceed to the assignment, saving the rest of the rules for the next lesson.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-11 17:28:04','2015-03-11 18:54:58'),(138,45,'Rules of Composition (Part 2 of 2)',NULL,'<p><strong>16.

Shoot from unique angles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Varying the angle from which you shoot offers a non-standard, and therefore more interesting, perspective. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to get down low and shoot from the ground level or stand on a chair to get some height for an out of the ordinary perspective. One of my photography teachers once said to me, &ldquo;the more ridiculous you look while taking a photo, the better the photo will probably be.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s that extra bit of effort you put into your image that will make it stand out over others.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Getting down low can be particularly important when photographing children. Most adults never look at kids from their own eye level and are instead always looking down at them from an elevated position. Images that show kids from their eye level give us a glimpse of what it&rsquo;s like to be a kid again.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Photographing people from different angles can also imply certain characteristics about that person.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br />For instance, photographing a person from slightly below can make that person feel a little more authoritative or powerful.<br /><br />{attachment1}<br /><br />Give people a view they aren&rsquo;t used to seeing.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br /><br />Another unusual perspective.

Use elements within your image to frame other elements</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>This one is fairly self-explanatory. The elements that are used to frame can be found in nature, such as trees, or elements that you as the photographer control or use to your compositional advantage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>18. Switch up your aspect ratios</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you find yourself shooting primarily in landscape mode versus portrait mode, try changing things up. See how the scene changes when you compose for a horizontal versus vertical frame.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Also, consider venturing away from the standard 2x3 aspect ratio to 4x5, 16x9, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>This image by Chris Connolly was cropped to a 15x8 ratio and evokes the feeling of a panoramic image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>19. Allow subjects to fall into silhouette</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Place your subject in front of a bright background and then expose for the background.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Letting your subject fall into shadow and allowing only the shape of it to show.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>By showing just the shape of your subjects, you can eliminate a lot of distracting elements, such as a tacky logo on a person&rsquo;s shirt or the color of the subject.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>In addition, traditional portraits can sometimes be difficult to relate to, especially if your subject and viewer aren&rsquo;t acquainted. Using silhouettes of people allows you to have a human element in your frame that is anonymous and therefore relatable.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>20. Seek out textures</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Texture-heavy images can actually give the viewer an idea of what touching that object or surface would be like. It makes the scene more real and interesting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be on the lookout for peeling paint, crunchy leaves, the patina on a rusty antique, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>21. Find patterns</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Patterns, natural or manmade, give your image a visual beat or rhythm and can be very attractive to a viewer, pulling them into an image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment12}<br /><br />It&rsquo;s easy to see why this image by Wolfgang Weinhardt was shortlisted for the 2014 World Photography Awards.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}<br /><br /><br /><strong>22. Straighten your horizon</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you think no one will notice, you&rsquo;re wrong. I&rsquo;m one of many who can tell a horizon is crooked immediately upon seeing an image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If at all possible, horizons should be straight, BUT if it makes sense for your image, go ahead and let your horizon be crooked. No matter what, though - crooked or straight: commit to your decision!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t let it come across as accidental. The worse thing is coming across an image that would benefit greatly from having a straightened horizon, but where it feels like the photographer was just too lazy or careless to bother. It reflects poorly on you as the photographer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment14}<br /><br />The crookedness of this photo was clearly intentional.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>23. Crop carefully</strong></p>\r\n<p>Be careful that you do not chop people off at their joints because it leaves the viewer feeling uncomfortable. It leaves them feeling oddly like they&rsquo;re looking at an amputee.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of having really clean images free of a lot of clutter and distractions, and a huge part of my obsession is making sure that I have clean edges. When you crop an image, view it on a dark, as well as a light background. Doing so will make obvious any leftover edges or spots that pull your viewer&rsquo;s eye to a place where you don&rsquo;t want it to go.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you find something distracting at an edge, crop or clone it out if possible.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Messy edges pre-edit:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment17}<br /><br />Post-edit clean edges:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment18}<br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>24. Breaking the rules</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Each photographer decides which rules are most important to them and decides which ones to break and when. Breaking the rules can add tension to a scene and can also create very evocative, even groundbreaking images.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>There are, of course, tried and true rules and tricks that have withstood the test of time, and there are things that turn into fads and get tiresome over time.</li>\r\n</ul>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-11 17:31:19','2015-03-11 18:57:00'),(139,45,'Evoking Mood & Emotion, Finding Inspiration',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">So far in this class, we&rsquo;ve covered the elements and principles of visual art and design, as well as the basic rules of composition. Armed with this knowledge, you have a strong basis for not only analyzing images that you see as a consumer of visual art, but also for creating your own images. <br /><br />That being said, however, having a firm grasp on these rules does not ensure that you will all of a sudden be taking great photographs. There are plenty of technically and compositionally great photographs that still aren&rsquo;t able to fully deliver. So what is it that these images are lacking and how can they be done better?<br /><br />Those particular images are often lacking mood, emotion, and a way for us to really feel connected to the image. So in this lesson, I want to talk about certain compositional elements and strategies that will help to evoke those feelings.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in Lesson 1, I can&rsquo;t teach you to see, but I can help point things out that might be important along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s dive right in.<br /><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>MOOD AND EMOTION:</strong><br /><br />The most important thing to remember is:&nbsp; Mood and emotion &ldquo;trump&rdquo; (i.e. are much more compelling than) technical and compositional perfection.<br /><br />How can you visually evoke mood?<br /><br /><strong>1. Color</strong> <br /><br />{attachment1} <br /><br />Warm colors such as red, orange, and yellow tend to evoke feelings of warmth, comfort, hostility, and even anger. Cool colors such as blue, green, and purple evoke feelings of coolness, sadness, and indifference.<br /><br />Here&rsquo;s a list of some of the mood words people associate with certain colors:<br /><br />Red = anger, hostility, energy<br />Orange = excitement, romance, comfort<br />Yellow = light, cheerful <br />Green = refreshing, growth, life, freshness<br />Blue = cool, clean, calm, sad, indifferent<br />Purple = dramatic, luxurious<br />The red in this image below gives off strength, energy, and makes a bold statement.

Gesture</strong><br /><br />A gesture is a movement, particularly of the hand or head, that expresses an idea or a meaning. It&rsquo;s usually fleeting and serves as a non-verbal way of communicating. <br /><br />The subject of this photo is communicating a feeling of peace and relaxation through the stretch of her arms and her closed eyes.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Emily Blincoe.</span><br /><br />{attachment7} <br /><br />Shy laughter caught on camera, signalled by the hand pulled up to the subject&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Cindy Loughridge.</span><br /><br />{attachment8} <br /><br />Showing her face, but still maintaining an air of mystery by pulling her hair back from her face ever so slightly with a delicate hand movement.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Sonya Yu.</span><br /><br />{attachment9}<br /><br />This is a beautiful photo on its own, but to me, the thing that puts the finishing touch on the image is the gentle flip of the wrist. &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Sonya Yu</span>.&nbsp; <br /><br />{attachment10}<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>3. Weather</strong><br /><br />How does weather affect the way you feel? Speaking generally, sunny weather makes us feel happy, energized, and social. Stormy weather makes us feel somber, depressed, and lonely. It seems fitting, then, that if we are showing that kind of weather in our images, our viewers might feel some of those same feelings.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when it comes to weather, we&rsquo;re all always at the mercy of circumstance. Plenty of photographers I know wake up every morning to peek out the window to decide if it would be worth it to go out and shoot. Sometimes, it means just heading straight back to bed, but other times, it means a fiery orange sunrise shining through dramatic morning clouds - <span style=\"color: #000000;\">A sunny, happy photo</span>.<br /><br />{attachment11}<br /><br />The bright colors and the sun flare make this photo feel upbeat and happy, even though you can&rsquo;t see the expressions of either person in the photo.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Lauren Randolph.</span><br /><br />{attachment12}<br /><br />The dark figure facing off against a rather dramatic looking cloud makes for a very gloomy, ominous mood. <br /><br />{attachment13}<br /><br />The feeling you get from this beach on an overcast day like this is much different from the feeling you&rsquo;d get if it was bright and sunny.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Andrew Kim.</span><br /><br />{attachment14}<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>4. Light</strong><br /><br />As we already know, light is the most fundamental element behind photography. Without light, photos would not and could not even exist. It&rsquo;s up to us as photographers to decide how we want to use the light we have at our disposal to create images that capture and convey what we want. <br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Artificial light aside, there are many ways we can find and use natural light to our advantage. Photographers often love to shoot at&nbsp; Golden Hour and Blue Hour. With a little patience, moonlight can serve as a good light source, as well. Have a look at the following examples to feel how a viewer&rsquo;s perception can change based solely on the light.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Natural soft window light is bright, clean, relaxing.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Cindy Loughridge</span>.<br /><br />{attachment15}<br /><br />Golden hour light makes for the longest and most interesting shadows that help to tell your story and set the mood.&nbsp; <span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Pete Halvorsen</span>.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment16}<br /><br />Blue hour at its best.

Shadow</strong><br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Use of shadows in imagery is very closely related to a photographer&rsquo;s use of light and can be used to add a sense of drama, mystery, and even fear to an image.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The shadow of a hand on a dark night. &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Kelly Symes</span>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment19}<br /><br />Long evening shadows on the beach add dramatic flair. &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Javier Costa</span>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment20}<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>6. Film Grain (Digital &ldquo;Noise&rdquo;)</strong><br /><br />Film grain and the added digital equivalent of it (within reason) can create a feeling of nostalgia.&nbsp; The film grain in this image helps to make this image feel timeless. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment21}<br /><br />This image would feel completely different if not for the film grain. &nbsp;<span style=\"color: #000000;\">Photo by Cindy Loughridge</span>. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment22}<br /></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>7. Shallow Depth of Field</strong><br /><br />Opening up your aperture and shooting wide open for a very shallow depth of field creates a soft, dreamy look that can be quite striking. This is one of the reasons why people choose to pay more for prime lenses that open to wider apertures.<br /><br />Shooting with a macro lens makes the depth of field even more extreme. <br /><br />{attachment23}<br /><br />Depth of field is made even shallower when you use a telephoto lens or zoom in as far as your lens will allow. <br /><br />{attachment24}<br /><br /><br /><strong>8. Shoot Into the Light</strong><br /><br />Shooting into the light adds drama and depth. Here are three ways to approach shooting into bright light, each of which has its place:<br /><br />1. expose for the background, silhouette the foreground<br />2. expose for the foreground, blow out the background<br />3. expose for the background, add light to the foreground<br /><br />Balancing the fine line between options 1 and 2 - letting the sky be blown out while still maintaining some detail in the foreground trees.<br /><br />{attachment25}<br /><br />Allowing the subject to fall mostly into silhouette like this can lead to stunning results. Photo by Emily Blincoe.<br /><br />{attachment26}<br /><br />An example of exposing for the background and adding light. Photo by Lauren Randolph.<br /><br />{attachment27}<br /><br /><br /><strong>9. Long Exposures</strong><br /><br />Long exposures allow you to show people the world in ways they don&rsquo;t normally see it. Sometimes, it&rsquo;s that added little piece that you need to take an image to the next level.<br /><br />{attachment28}<br /><br />{attachment29}<br /><br /><br /><strong>10. Black &amp; White / Sepia / Other</strong><br /><br />Again, this is presenting the world to your viewer in a way they don&rsquo;t normally see it. <br /><br />How would you feel if this image was in its original color showcasing a purple dahlia?<br /><br />{attachment30}<br /><br />Imagine how different the next two images would look and feel if they were in color. Photo by Emily Blincoe.<br /><br />{attachment31}<br /><br />Photo by Andrew Kim, below.<br /><br />{attachment32}<br /><br /><br /><strong>11. Expression / Emotion</strong><br /><br />One of your goals as a photographer should be to capture the emotions already present in a scene. If what you&rsquo;re looking at doesn&rsquo;t make you feel anything, then how can you expect it to make your viewer feel anything?<br /><br />To do this successfully, it requires an ability to recognize what it is about a scene that creates that feeling. Look at images from other photographers to see if you can pinpoint what it is about the image that is causing that emotional reaction in you.<br />Color and expression come into play in this simple portrait.<br /><br />{attachment33}<br /><br />The gesture and the emotion from the musician elevate the mood of this photo.

When I use the word preparation I use it in the context of two very different elements of portraiture - the technical and the creative.</p>\r\n<p>First off, we shall tackle the technical side. You will be told there is such a lens as a portrait lens. These are normally said to be around the 90mm mark in 35mm terms. But this is not your only \"weapon\" in capturing your subject. It can be very good for a head shot but it does tend to alienate the subject from their environment. This happens in two ways:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Firstly, it diminishes your angle of view thus taking away a great deal of the background.</li>\r\n<li>Secondly, the longer the lens, the shorter your depth-of-field and often a 90mm lens will completely blur your background, especially if shot on a wide f-stop.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I am a big believer in using your subject\'s environment in a portrait, but we shall come to that in lesson three. The wider lenses, including a standard lens, allow you to capture what is around your subject. The first example below is a portrait of the artist Ralph Steadman, I turned to a very wide lens for two reasons. Firstly, I felt that the environment he surrounded himself with in his studio was an important element of Ralph as an artist and a person and secondly, simply because space was an issue. To get everything I desired in the frame from the angle I needed, I had to go for a wide-angle lens, in this case a 28mm.<br />This example aside, it is a good idea to be in close proximity to your subject anyway. This way your subject will feel like he or she is a part of something and not just being viewed upon from afar. You don\'t want them to start feeling alienated. If you are shouting directions across a room it can be very impersonal and not at all intimate. You want to be able to talk to your subject and allow them to relax and feel at ease in this very alien situation. It will be much easier for your subject if they feel more like they are participating in a social occasion. Don\'t be scared to move around your subject either, a tripod can be very daunting when you are being photographed and make you feel very rigid. You must remember that most people who sit for portraits are not used to being in front of a camera.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An example of getting close to your subjects is shown in the second photo below.&nbsp; This image is taken from a series of portraits I took in Jaipur, India for an exhibition. I spent four days in a street where every shop was a motorcycle repair shop. I wanted to capture the energy and life in the faces of the Chi boys who took refreshments round to the workers. So I used a 35mm lens to enable me to be right in front of them and keep their attention focused on the camera.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />If you can, make sure you are armed with a range of lenses for whatever is thrown at you in terms of the sitter\'s habitat and the sort of image you want to create. If you do not have a plethora of lenses to choose from, do not worry, a wide-angled lens of around 35mm or a \"standard\" 50mm lens should allow you to cover most bases, from close-up, to a more landscape, spatially aware approach.</p>\r\n<p>There are obviously instances where a longer \"portrait style\" lens and a tighter shot can work. The next shot is an example of this. I photographed Lauren Leverne in a studio in London. I worked with Lauren on various wider, full-length style portraits but didn\'t feel like I was capturing the true essence of her personality. They seemed too posed and too much like a fashion shot. She has a character brimming with the love of life. Her eyes seemed to be popping out of her head with glee so I came in close and took a simple eyes-to-camera headshot. I even broke the one rule of photography I actually think works - the \"rule-of-thirds.\" By placing her in the middle of the frame, the viewer is completely drawn to her eyes and thus to her personality. This, by the way, was still taken on a standard 50mm lens.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />The moral of this, I guess, is that there are no rules about which lens you should use for a portrait, as there is no real \"portrait\" lens. Those that insist on inventing such rules, deserve to have them broken at every possible opportunity. Never be afraid to do this. Remember, the final image is \"King.\" It is this one captured moment, your portrayal of your subject, your interpretation that will justify your choice of lens and composition.</p>\r\n<p>This brings me on to the creative research and preparation.</p>\r\n<p>As a photographer you find that, relatively speaking, you spend very little time actually releasing the shutter on your camera. A lot of your time is spent on research and ideas. Many people are of the school of thinking that studying at too many pictures by other photographers will only lead to you copying them.</p>\r\n<p>Well, this is a fallacy. What you will end up doing is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Understanding photography.</li>\r\n<li>Understanding how to use light.</li>\r\n<li>Understanding how to compose an image.</li>\r\n<li>Understanding how to capture a telling moment.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>All time spent in bookshops and magazine emporiums is invaluable to your eye and understanding of images. Look through as many photo-books as possible and not just portrait books, inspiration can be found in many different realms. I have included a short list of suggestions but please, immerse yourself and discover what you find to be incredible images, then try and work out why you like them and how they have been taken. For example in my research, I keep coming back the work of photojournalists and reportage photographers. My main inspirations are Robert Frank, Elliot Erwitt and Tony Ray-Jones. These guys capture moments of intense power and really delve in to the souls of their subjects leaving you feeling truly moved by the experience of seeing these images.</p>\r\n<p>Now to researching your subject. When I approach a portrait, I sit down in-front of my computer and search. For example, I was recently commissioned by a German art<br />magazine to take a portrait of a German artist of whom I had no knowledge, whatsoever. So I began simply by \"Googling\" his name. I then followed links and found his work and details of current and past exhibitions and tried to garner some idea of who this man is and how he approaches his work and life. In this instance I had limited information to work with. As it turned out, this was the first portrait he had sat for so I had no idea, when I turned up on the day, what he looked like. I am using this example because it shows how your research will continue even as you shoot. When I arrived at his studio, I took time to chat with the artist about how he worked and what were his influences and techniques and how he, as a person, lived his life. By taking this approach of not shooting any images for the first hour of our sitting I managed to not only arm myself with ideas on how best to tell this man\'s story with a single image, but he also felt much more relaxed as I was taking a real interest in him and his work. I found out that movement was a key element in his approach to his work and that he is very much a person that shuns publicity. From this, I set about a series of long exposure images of him, moving around his work and a set of images where he is dwarfed by his large canvases and is very small in the frame, allowing his work to speak for him. Please see th next two images.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So the lesson here is to be as prepared as possible with both knowledge of your subject and ideas on how to depict them visually when you arrive at the point of taking the portrait. But don\'t be afraid to digress from these on the day. Keep your mind and your eyes open and allow yourself to bin these ideas for something you discover in that moment when you find yourself within the company of your subject.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Reading list:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Tony Ray-Jones: A retrospective view<br />Tony Ray-Jones was an incredible photographer who sadly died well before his time at the age of just 30.

You do not need a huge lighting rig to produce a fine portrait especially as we will essentially be focussing on portraiture within the environment of your sitter on this course. The key elements we will be covering in this section will be the use and control of day light and small flash equipment to gain the best results in your portraiture.</p>\r\n<p>Lighting is a very important element to a portrait. Often on my portrait assignments, I travel to the living or work space that my sitter inhabits. The lighting conditions and proportions of these locations are often unknown to me so my lighting tends to be small and simple. I also don\'t like to come along to a subject\'s own space and invade it with big lighting rigs. This not only limits the space available to shoot in and can be inconvenient for my host but also, sometimes, I don\'t want to creatively and visually influence the set up of the space too much.</p>\r\n<p>My first example below is how simple lighting can produce a great result. Take a look at image one. This was taken for a German magazine who commissioned me to do a series of portraits in the bars of Soho, London. Frequenting such establishments being a favourite pass time of mine it was an offer I could not refuse. The bar of choice was tiny but full of character and gaining access out of opening hours was not an option. This was lit by a small bracket mounted Metz flash gun attached to my camera, with a sheet or two of diffusion over it to spread and soften the light, as a light on a stand would have been impractical and daylight hasn\'t been seen in this particular bar for quite sometime. Okay, I know what you are thinking, this doesnʼt teach me how to light a portrait. Fair enough. But the reason I am showing you this is that you do not have to be afraid of taking portraits without a big fancy lighting set up. It is how you portray your subject that counts. This lighting was perfect as it gave an overall light which did not cast big ugly shadows over the environment of the bar. Without the diffusion material it would have been quite an ugly, harsh light.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A lot of the times, especially indoors, having an overall flat light will ruin a portrait. This can drain the life out of a situation and just look boring and soulless. This is where your understanding and use of daylight comes in. My rule-of-thumb is always try and use available light. This is not always possible but it can make for a beautiful portrait. The second example of lighting portraits is that which follows below. This was a portrait I shot of a German artist, you will hopefully remember images four and five from the first lesson. At the end of the shoot I was chatting with Daniel before I headed on my way and I noticed the beautiful blue daylight coming in from a tiny window in his studio. There would never have been enough light for the main wide angled shot I had taken earlier of him and his work, but for a study of his face it was perfect. I asked him to step as close to the window as possible and using a slow shutter speed, I think it was 1/30th of a second and a wide open f/stop of f2.8 I took this portrait. The light is so beautiful and it really feels like a study of the artist\'s soul.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Light can be used in a myriad of ways. If you look at Richard Avedon\'s portraits in his book \"In the American West\" you will see that he used a very flat daylight. He would either soften the sun\'s rays with a silk screen or shoot in the shade of a building to allow a soft light to evenly cover his subject so that you were drawn in to the whole being of that particular person. Whereas, with the work of Albert Watson, one of the great fashion and portrait photographers we see a more dramatic use of light. Lots of silhouettes and very directional light picking out and accentuating certain features.</p>\r\n<p>A good tool for controlling daylight if you have no flash equipment is a reflector. The company Lastolite makes very good ones, but most camera shops stock reflectors from various manufacturers. Even a piece of white card will do the trick. This will enable you to punch a little light back in to the face of your subject. I would personally tend to steer clear of silver reflectors as I find these to be a little harsh, although in very low light they can produce that little bit extra to enable a decent f-stop.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s now look at a few different uses of daylight. Wherever you are, even on the most flat and dull day you will always be able to find a bit of good light. Light can also be used as a prop to bring out a side of your sitters personality.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Back light:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The third photograph below is an example of using the sun within the frame of your shot. Here I wanted to get the felling of a light airy summers day for a portrait of the two actors Damian Lewis and Jodhi May for the BBC. The scene we wanted to re-create was a picnic so the use of the sun in the top right hand corner was perfect to get that hazy summers day feeling with the flare of the sun coming through the trees in to the lens. The result is that the sun becomes a character within the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Direct sunlight:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Generally I veer away from using direct sun light as it\'s harshness is not conducive to good portrait light. Here though, in the next picture, given the space around the subject and his size within the frame it seemed to suit the image perfectly. It brings out the statues on the column as big silhouette like features and adds a certain grandness and power to the sitter that likens him to the statues. As does his formal stance. This is also a good example of not being afraid to place your subject small within the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Soft overcast light:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The image that follows shows how an overcast day can still bring good light to a portrait. On the day this portrait of the actor Robert Lyndsay was taken the sky was full of clouds. It was in fact a typical autumnal day. This however provided a perfectly flat neutral light that worked perfectly with the colours within the frame. By using a high colour film, as I did - Kodak Portra 160VC - the image still remains punchy without any distinguishing sun light making an appearance. If shooting on digital this can be aided by a little tweaking of the saturation in Photoshop.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Side light:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lighting from one side can create a very dramatic effect. With the next photo example, I have simply used the daylight coming in from a window. By not bouncing anything back on to the shadowed side you end up with a more dramatic picture. If you wanted to register more detail on the shaded side then you would simply use a little white reflector to bounce a little light back in.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Available artificial light:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The final image below is a portrait of the artist Jane Lushington taken in her Chelsea home. I wanted to capture the essence of Jane within her living and working environment so I opted to use the available daylight along with the light from her angle poise lamp that she played cards by. The daylight gives an even overall base light while the lamp added a little side light to give the picture some depth. If I had lit Jane with a soft box from the front then the image would have been far too flat and lifeless.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>As you can see you really do not need to have a big lighting set up to produce a good portrait. In-fact, the use of daylight will usually add to the atmosphere and ambiance of the story you are telling about your subject. As we have seen with the side light from as simple a source as a window it can also bring a little drama your picture. So, by all means be prepared with a flash but always try and use the available light. And don\'t be afraid to use that natural light. It is not lazy to not have lots of lights set up, it takes a lot of know how and creativity to control and harness the light from the sky.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-17 14:54:29','2015-03-22 11:54:57'),(142,49,'Breaking Conventions: A Portrait is More Than Just a Face',NULL,'<p>Although there is still a place for traditional portraiture today, there is a lot more we can do and use to tell the story of our subject and indeed a lot we can find in the traditional work of the pioneers of the portrait.</p>\r\n<p>Let us take a look at two things about portraiture.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>What we want to achieve through taking a portrait</li>\r\n<li>What we will inevitably end up with through our attempts to portray this person.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The art of the portrait is to show a truth about the subject through a single image or indeed a series of images. Ultimately it is up to the photographer to decide which truth is presented. This opens up the possibility for the image to say as much about the taker as the taken. You, as the photographer, have to decide how to portray your sitter as truthfully as possible, meaning the truth as you see it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One of the best tools for finding this truth is time. It is not always possible to spend time with your sitter, their schedules can limit availability but any time you can spend with your sitter prior to picking up the camera can be invaluable. We touched on this in lesson one but I think it is worth revisiting as the time that you spend with your sitter can influence how you interpret your subjects truth. The Photographer Diane Arbus was one photographer who would utilise this time with her sitters to the maximum effect. In example one we see a great example of a portrait where the environment tells us a lot about the person who is in the frame. If we analise this image we could say that the pose and the eye contact reminds us of a traditional portrait sitting but it is the inclusion of the environment around the subject that gives it an extra dimension. Although under traditional terms the subject is smallish in the frame the space around her is by no means dead. There is so much information surrounding the subject that we really begin learn the story of this person. This on top of the eye contact and the distance and defensive pose we begin to learn that the real person behind the show girl is quite private and guarded.</p>\r\n<p>The theme of this lesson brings us away from the traditional confines of the portrait. When you think of portraits you generally think of the sitterʼs face but we can garner a lot more information from other elements that we can include in the image. This is where the standard 50mm lens and the wider angled lens comes in to itʼs own. More and more editorial clients these days are looking for something a little different from a head shot when they come to commission portraiture. They want to see a new innovative approach where a story can be told about the subject rather than just a representation of the said subject. This is where traveling to your subjectʼs home or work place can add to your image. Try and think about your composition in these instances as if it were a landscape shot. The best way to approach your subject in the case is to talk to them. Donʼt pose them, let them become relaxed and wander around them seeking the perfect angle and composition for your image. Then when they are relaxed and unaware of your role as a photographer anymore you can catch them unawares. This approach has more in common with a reportage style but is no less a way of portraying your subject.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>An example of this is found in example two. This a portrait I was commissioned to shoot of John Malkovich for The British Telegraph. Here I took the approach of chatting with the subject, more to put myself at ease, and at one point I asked him a question and his reaction was to gaze down in to his hands and ponder his response for a while. This I felt perfectly summed up this internally complex and intelligent character.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next image shows us another way of interpreting the portrait without just filling the frame with the face. In example three we have another shot from the series of portraits of the artist Ralph Steadman. Ralph is known for his grotesque cartoon like illustrations of characters and real people. He is especially known for his illustrations for Hunter S. Thompsonʼs books. He is also known for his flicked ink signature and nobody really knows what he looks like, or very few people anyway so I thought a great way of portraying him would be to photograph his hand whilst he was drawing. This image also shows the wall behind his desk that has become splattered with ink from his flicked ink signature. A great way of telling a story about someone without even showing his face.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the example four we see a portrait of Henri Matisse by the photographic legend Henri Cartier-Bresson. Strictly speaking I guess this would not really be considered as a<br />contemporary portrait but only within the confines of time. This is actually a perfect example of how the environment around your subject can not only set a scene but tell us about the character we are looking at. A simple headshot of Matisse would no doubt be amazing, his face alone would have many stories to tell but this images opens up a whole new narrative about his mindset at this particular time in his life. By stepping back from the norm Cartier-Bresson has revealed a lot more about his sitter.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>We have another example of this in example five. This is a portrait I took of a maverick guerilla style filmmaker and civil rights activist who had just made a low budget film based on a London council estate. I wanted to show him within the environment of his work and in a way that echoed his activism by making him quite anonymous within the frame. Like he is a character who exists within the shadows of everyday life.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The last example is a more extreme example of a contemporary portrait. Here in example six we have a shot of Ralph Steadmanʼs desk. No sign of the subject anywhere within the frame yet we can learn a lot about the person who owns and works at this desk just by looking at what he surrounds himself with and the way in which he works.</p>\r\n<p>So as you can see you are by no means restricted to a simple head and shoulders shot when you come to looking at an interesting way of portraying your subject. Take a step back from the situation and start thinking about what makes the person you are photographing the character that they are. Are they driven by their work? Do they live for their family? Can you see this person in his environment without even needing to see that person in the frame? Is there a part of that person, ie: a hand, that could sum up this persons personality, work or passion? The key is to think laterally and to produce an image that shows the truth of your subject in a creative way that echoes their personality. And even to have some fun with the structure of traditional portraiture.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-17 14:57:50','2015-03-22 11:54:09'),(143,49,'Capturing Subject and Moment, Synergy and an Open Mind',NULL,'<p>Okay, so we have looked at choosing the right lenses, how to use the available lighting and how to use composition and the environment of your sitter to give your portraits an extra edge. Now we come to an issue that is as important, if not more so, as all of these factors. This is the matter of how the chemistry between yourself, the photographer, and your subject on the day that you take the portrait affects the final portrayal of your subject and how you channel the emotions and mood of your subject in to a true representation of them on that particular day. Within this we are also going to discuss the two main conflicting styles of the contemporary portrait, the creative directed portrait and the reportage portrait.</p>\r\n<p>These decisions we make on the spur of the moment, once we have met our subject and assessed the feeling of the day, will affect how we use the skills we have learnt in the previous three lessons. Do we want to keep a distance and observe them without interference, do we want to be close up to this person and really pull something out of them, or do we want to investigate their environment and produce a portrait that is true to<br />their overall character rather than the mood of the character that particular day. The position of photographer is a very powerful one and you need to wield your camera with care.</p>\r\n<p>Enveloping these approaches, as mentioned earlier, there are the two main ways of taking a portrait. The capturing of an image of a person as they are at that particular time and the creation of an image for that specific subject. Letʼs look at the latter of the categories first.</p>\r\n<p>Here are two excellent purveyors of the creative style of portraiture. Firstly we shall look at Annie Leibovitz. Annie Leibovitz tells a story with her portraits, although productions would be a closer analogy. She takes a character, finds their most famous or prominent quality and then magnifies that through an almost cartoon like approach. A bit like the Simpsons I suppose where each character has one defining quirk or character trait and that is them. This is not a criticism as this is a very interesting way of portraying someone who has one overwhelming side to their personality. In the first image below we see Annieʼs portrait of Paul Newman for Vanity Fair. Here Annie has taken Paul Newmanʼs character through his most famous role, that of Eddie Felson in The Hustler and twinned it with his own character of the grand old man of Hollywood. He has the stage set of an old time bar with the background of a theatrical setting perfectly summing up his public persona. In the follow image we have Annieʼs portrait of Keith Richards. A splendidly simple image of Rock and Roll excess that is so perfectly matched to his approach to life. You donʼt even have to see his face to get a glimpse in to his psyche.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The second purveyor of this sort of posed portrait is a photographer who very much takes his approach to portraiture from the worlds of fashion and music, David LaChappelle. The photo that follows is a wonderfully staged head shot with a difference. A totally fabricated moment that is more like a work of fantasy than a portrait.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These are examples of how the photographer can almost fabricate an image for the subject they are portraying. Are these a true representation of the sitter? Well, maybe they are but they are certainly exaggerated forms of the truth and they certainly still hold a strong position in the art of portraiture.</p>\r\n<p>From a completely different school of portraiture a reportage approach can be very powerful. In the next photograph below we see how a very low key presence from the photographer Diane Arbus has resulted in her capturing a very intimate moment that maybe wouldnʼt have been seen if the photographer took a more controlling and dominant approach. Here we see the idea of patience coming in to the armory of the portrait photographer. This is a stolen moment within the confines of the home of the subject that tells us, the viewer, a great deal about the person we have been presented with. It is like the photographer isnʼt even there, a very different approach to the creative production style of Annie Leibovitz and David Lachapelle and some would say a lot more powerful as it is a pure slice of their life. We feel like a fly on the wall, a very privileged place to be.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Another photographer who took this response is a British Photographer called Tony Ray-Jones. In the first photo below we see a list of rules from his notes. Notice the words \"Be Patient\" and \"See if everything in the background relates to the subject\". Two very important rules of the contemporary portrait that we have discussed in previous lessons. These are shown beautifully in the next photo. You can tell that he has waited for exactly the moment that sums up the lonely and contemplative life of the subject and the setting for what we imagine is a daily ritual for lunch or afternoon tea. This portrait really lets our imaginations run and paint our own story for the subject. I would guess each of us would come up with a different idea about who this lady truly is. The trait of a great reportage portrait.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, let us recap a minute. We have worked out that for all our preparation that we discussed in lesson one, that alone is not enough. Okay if we set out with a definitive image that we want to create like David LaChapelle then we may stick rigidly to it but if we want to capture a stolen moment from our subjectʼs life then we will inevitably err from the plan set before. We have to be ready to judge moods and emotions and use these to our<br />advantage to capture a truth about the subject. If we see that someone is uneasy about a certain subject that you want to highlight through the portrait do you push it and risk losing the shot for the chance of an incredible image or do you step back and try and capture something about the person from a different aspect of his character.So, let us recap a minute.

The first shows how he could manipulate his subject by picking on a certain element of their character. In the photograph below we have his portrait of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. They entered the studio and were very aloof so, knowing that the couple were great dog lovers, Avedon fabricated a story about how his taxi that morning had run over a dog on the way, as soon as he saw their reaction he took the portrait which resulted in a very rare shot were they appear with empathy rather than seeming aloof and detached.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The other side of his portrait taking skills is shown in the final image that follows. Here is his portrait of Marilyn Monroe. He had taken a plethora of images of Marilyn performing her public persona throughout the portrait session that day, then at the very end as he was packing up he saw the very private and vulnerable side of her that she hid so well from her public.&nbsp; He asked if he could do one more shot of her sitting there, she did not reply so he took this portrait. An image that tells far more about Marilyn Monroe than all the images he took previously that day just because he allowed himself to veer off from his plan.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So, there you have it. Being a portrait photographer is more than just having an eye for composition and being technically accomplished. It is about understanding people, knowing how to get to the truth from someone or knowing how to find a truth and create an exaggerated form of this for the sake of the image. It is more than having a plan and sticking rigidly to that. The greatest portrait photographers will plan and then approach with an open mind, observing their subjects behavior and habitat to form a truth about them in the form of an image.</p>\r\n<p>I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for taking this course and I hope that you have found the inspiration through it to get out there and capture some amazing images.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-17 15:00:17','2015-03-22 11:52:56'),(144,47,'Learning the Characteristics',NULL,'<p>The 50mm lens is often referred to as that focal length most closely approximating the view of the human eye. This is actually not so. In fact, in 135 format terms, it is a perspective of around 22mm that comes closest to seeing the way we humans do.</p>\r\n<p>The \"normal\" or \"standard\" lens, as the \"50-mil\" is commonly known, has been on the photo scene now since at least the 1930s. As a result, it possesses one of the best understood and highly corrected optical formulas in camera history. The lens remains to this day a brilliant piece of optical engineering. Even the least expensive 50mm lens you can buy will be optically superior to current offerings of \"consumer zooms,\" often accompanying new camera purchases. You may not notice it in a standard small print, but it will be obvious (given good camera craft) in larger prints of all sizes.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s take an overview look in this first lesson at all the pluses of putting just one lens - the 50 - on your camera and setting it through its optical and creative paces.</p>\r\n<p>Besides its indisputable sharpness, the biggest advantage to placing a prime 50mm lens in your shooting program is its ability to yield excellent results when applied to low-light situations.</p>\r\n<p>Speed refers to the lens\'s ability to gather light. There is a difference of approximately 3.5 stops between f/1.8, the typical maximum aperture for an entry-level 50mm lens, and f/5.6, the typical maximum aperture at the portrait end of a \"consumer\" zoom. This is a huge difference in practice. Lighting that would require a difficult shutter speed of 1/8 second at f/5.6 on the consumer zoom, would permit easy hand-held photography at 1/90 at f/1.8 with the 50mm prime. This extra speed gives one the ability to shoot candid pictures in dim lighting without using on-camera flash as a main lighting source.</p>\r\n<p>Take a look at the portrait example below. Made in the moutains of northeastern Afghanistan, this close-up was taken to relate the sadness this older man was feeling as he watched his village\'s sawmill (a major source of local income) go up in flame. He stood at a distance - in the shadows where light was low. I opened my aperture to f/2.0 and moved close for a quick capture and then walked away.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Accurate focus is essential when shooting with a fast lens at wide apertures. The wider the aperture the shallower the depth of field (or zone of apparent sharpness) in the photograph. You\'ll notice in the photo above that this man\'s face is not tack-sharp throughout.&nbsp; This is a consequence of the wide aperture needed to make this photo.&nbsp; This said, when photographing people close-up with any aperture setting, focus most accurately on the eye closed to the your camera.&nbsp; As a general rule, if this eye apears in sharp focus, the rest of the face will appear to be more so too.</p>\r\n<p>For this, you will need to learn to use the AF system of your camera to make sure the area you want is sharp (for example, your subject\'s eyes) even if it is not in the center of the frame. Usually this is done by first locking in an auto-focus setting, then recomposing. However, with fast moving subjects you may not have the time to do this. If your camera has multiple focusing points, you can try selecting one and keeping it over your area of critical focus. Or you may want to experiment with use of manual focus (which I do quite a bit). In any case, expect that a percentage of images will be rejected due to soft focus. Don\'t worry, this happens even to professionals; with practice your averages will improve.</p>\r\n<p>Another issue in this context is camera automation. If your camera has a built-in flash and \"easy\" shooting modes (such as \"portrait,\" \"action\" and \"landscape\") it may beep at you in some dim lighting conditions and pop-up the flash or even refuse to take a picture.&nbsp; In some camera situations your best bet might be to place your camera into a more flexible auto-exposure mode, such as aperture priority (Av or A). Generally in this mode the camera will assume you know what you are doing and permit a shutter speed that might cause camera shake (I have made sharp images with a 50mm lens as slow as 1/8th second by bracing myself against a wall or door frame.) Program (P) mode is okay too, provided the camera will permit a slower shutter speed without flash.</p>\r\n<p>Having said all this, don\' view the depth of field brought by a wide aperture setting on a prime 50 as something negative,&nbsp; To the contrary, shallow depth of field can be a great creativity catalyst.&nbsp; Take for example the simple still-life series shot in available light below.&nbsp; Comparing the first capture made with a great depth of field (i.e. f/11), notice how a wide aperture setting combined with critical focus changes the scene, shifting viewer attention from foreground to deeper within the composition.&nbsp; A photographer can capture some very stunning photos by applying imaginative use to a shallow depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While it\'s common knowledge that simply purchasing a particular piece of camera equipment won\'t necessarily improve your photography, I personally believe that a prime lens like the 50mm can go a long way in this direction. It\'s not just the quality of images this lens is capable of producing, it has a lot to do with limiting your photo-taking options too. The result: you\'ll be forced to think a lot more carefully about the kinds of photos you make. You\'re <em>camera craft</em> will improve.</p>\r\n<p>With zoom lenses the photographer usually just stands still and twists the zoom ring until he or she finds a composition that works.&nbsp; When in a crowd or any other situation where mobility is restricted, this is a fine solution.&nbsp; Other times it can be just a bit lazy.&nbsp; When using a prime lens you will learn to \"zoom with your feet,\" getting closer to your subject to eliminate distracting background, or backing away to include more context, as seen in the following two photos below.&nbsp; The first includes the context of a front door step; the second a \"zoomed-in\" detail of a pair of wooden shoes that can be found there.&nbsp; The \"effect\" is one similar to that obtained be using a wider lens and a longer lens, respectively.&nbsp; The technique is again simple - back up and use a high f-stop number (i.e. extensive depth of field) to simulate the wide-angle view; come in as close as possible with a wide aperture set to capture the subject as a mild telephoto lens would.&nbsp; It\'s just that simple.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In my view, all of this provides excellent training in learning to <em>see</em> effectively with the camera. When using prime lenses you become much more aware of the viewfinder as a compositional frame, and the various effects that a change of focal length will give you.&nbsp; In fact, after using prime lenses for a while, the pictures you then create with your zoom lens will improve, as you will have a better understanding of how focal length affects all the compositional elements that go into making a successful photograph.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 08:19:21','2015-03-23 08:25:25'),(145,47,'Exploring Versatility',NULL,'<p>This week\'s lesson is aimed at getting you even more comfortable going out with just one lens - the 50.&nbsp; I know from personal experience that this isn\'t the easiest thing to do.&nbsp; \"Do I really have all I need?\"&nbsp; \"Or - should I take my zoom along just in case?\"&nbsp; \"Will I honestly be able capture all the pictures I want with just this one lens?\"&nbsp; Scary stuff for sure, but you just have to trust you and your equipment (in minimalist form) that everything will be in order.&nbsp; Now, let\'s go out that door together and give it a try.</p>\r\n<p>\"Compact\" and \"unobtrusive\" are two of the adjectives frequently tagged to the small 50mm lens.&nbsp; And - these are exactly what give it (attached to a slr or dslr) its advantages when taken to the streets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are those who say that an expensive rangefinder camera like the Leica is \"best\" when it comes to moving and taking pictures of people in any type of context.&nbsp; While Leicas are small and their lenses of excellent optical quality, the computer-designed lenses (including the 50mm) produced by major manufacturers today are so good, that the only noticeable difference is in the up-and-over-market price of the formula.&nbsp; I\'ve worked with both and - bottom line - I have never noticed a difference in people\'s reaction with either.&nbsp; Today I use exclusively my 50mm f1.4 attached to my favorite digital single lens reflex body.</p>\r\n<p>\"Street Photography\" is a genre unto itself and one that I like very much, but it\'s definitely one that requires a bit of patience and a lot of \"camera craft\" - that knowledge of working your camera controls almost intuitively.&nbsp; It takes practice and a willingness to risk a \"no\" once in a while from potential subjects on the streets.&nbsp; However, when the latter does occur, I simply move on to the next situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Such happens rarely though when it\'s a short lens on the camera, versus a long, imposing zoom attached.&nbsp; Take the image below.&nbsp; This photograph was made in the hill-top town of Montalcino in Tuscany, Italy.&nbsp; It was mid-afternoon and most people were sitting at home eating or resting before continuing their work day.&nbsp; I was roaming the hilly streets - one camera, one lens (50mm of course) - searching for subjects.&nbsp; It was just about to acknowledge the fact that this just wasn\'t the time for things to happen, when this Capuchin monk strolled brisky up the empty cobblestone street.&nbsp; I readied my camera, noticing the \"subject-appropriateness\" of the background and just how much of it I wanted to emphasize or de-emphasize via my choice of aperture setting.&nbsp; I decided on a strong relationship between both, set sharp focus on the spot of pavement where I wanted to capture him in the composition and waited the minute or so for him to arrive.&nbsp; I held my camera in my hand, he glanced at me on approach and I pulled up and squeezed the shutter we the monk reached \"his mark.\"&nbsp; Both he and I would not have felt the same alone on this narrow street, had I followed him with my big, white 70-200mm zoom.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Before leaving this 50mm success story though, let me point out a few things about this photograph in general.&nbsp; First is its color palette. It\'s limited to just a very few related hues.&nbsp; The second characteristic of this photograph is it\'s \"simplicity\" - in terms of its non-distracting and thematically \"fitting\" (to the subject) background.&nbsp; Thirdly, the \"caught in mid-step\" capture lends a \"sense of moment\" to this photograph.&nbsp; This photographic \"moment\" - something \"special\" happening within the composition - raises the photograph beyond the ordinary and everyday.&nbsp; This is the icing on the cake as it were and something you always want to be on the lookout for when making pictures with an \"intimate\" focus length of 50mm.</p>\r\n<p>\"OK - so maybe this 50mm only thing can work for me,\" you say. \"But what more can it do to give me in terms of artistic expression?\"</p>\r\n<p>Enter the effect of \"Bokeh,\" a photographic term derived from the Japanese word for \"blurred\" or \"fuzzy.\"&nbsp; It refers to the out-of-focus areas in an image produced by a camera lens using a shallow depth of field. Different lens bokeh, produces different aesthetic qualities in out-of-focus backgrounds, which are often used in large part to reduce distractions and emphasize the primary subject. The 50mm prime does an excellent job with this.&nbsp; In the second photo below I applied a degree of bokeh, not so much to de-emphasize background elements within the frame, but to maintain a relationship while keeping viewer attention focused on the foreground subject.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Shot in eastern Afghanistan, I was intrigued by this interesting ethnic Pashtun face.&nbsp; In support of this, I waited for a second villager to cross the scene and set an aperture of f4.5 to capture both in combination.&nbsp; As above, there exists a limited color palette of closely related hues and a juxtaposition of frontal and profile views of these ethnically interesting people.&nbsp; The the out-of-focus effect - the \"bokeh\" - created by the aperture I set maintains the subject-background relationship I wanted, while softening it to the point of keeping viewers trained on what I most intended - this village elder\'s face.</p>\r\n<p>Doing double-duty, this out-of-focus effect approximates that produced by a mild telephoto lens (e.g. 85 - 100mm), as well.&nbsp; Below is an example of this.&nbsp; I used a wide aperture (i.e. f4.0) and moved close to align these statues of the Buddha so that they would appear \"stacked,\" one behind the other and \"compressed\" in terms of distance between, to give the impression that this photo was made with a lens longer than 50mm.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In the following capture of this scene, I kept the same wide aperture setting and simply shifted my sharp focus from the foreground mannequin to that in the background.&nbsp; In doing so, I also shifted viewer attention from front to back.&nbsp; Hollywood (and television producers) do this a lot too, using a thematically-fitting yet out-of-focus foreground subject to \"force\" viewer attention to the rear of the scene.&nbsp; A final point here - when attempting to create a mild \"tele\" effect with a 50mm lens, have foreground and background elements positioned relatively close together in the frame, otherwise the effect becomes less and more like the composition of the two Afghan men above.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Right!&nbsp; Pretty versatile indeed is this 50mm lens.&nbsp; So if you can compress its view (or the illusion of its perspective) in the telephoto direction, does this mean that it can be possible stretched into the wide-angle range, as well?&nbsp; Once again - mildly speaking yes.&nbsp; Below are two examples of this - one vertical, the other horizontal - together they offering view that might be had with a 35mm to 28mm lens.&nbsp; Turning my 50mm prime once more to life-like department store mannequins, I\'ve gotten down low and shot up toward my subjects.&nbsp; The angle I\'ve chosen serves to somewhat elongate the subject, leading to the impression that the photos were made with something wider than a 50-mil lens.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the oft-neglected 50mm is a major player in any lens line-up.&nbsp;

Either way, that lens I pack will invariably be my 50mm, f/1.4.&nbsp; Its application?&nbsp; I use the 50 for portraits, close-up details and situations where I just can\'t get enough light through the aperture of my f/2.8 wide-angle zoom.&nbsp; Take a look at the photo below, for example.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this shot, I\'ve put to work the 50mm prime to cover all three of these applications.&nbsp; The scene is a Shia Muslim religious observance called \"Ashura.\"&nbsp; I am in a mosque in the Afghanistan capital, Kabul and packed into a crowd to the point that I can hardly lift my arms and camera to make a shot.&nbsp; All I could do is turn my body a bit and in so doing, captured this young man slightly to my left and nearly just behind me.&nbsp; Several things grabbed my attention about this subject - his Islam-green headband with Persian script, his intense concentration on the Mullah sitting far ahead in the room and the small amount of light washing over him through a piece of translucent roofing directly above.&nbsp; Except for the latter, the level of light throughout the meeting hall was extremely low.</p>\r\n<p>My subject was barely a meter away from me, but despite our proximity, he remained fixed on proceedings at the front of the room and I was able to capture several candid photos, including all that I wanted in my portrayl of this young man.&nbsp; As for camera settings, I set my aperture first to f/2.0 to create a pleasing bokeh in the background and focused sharply on the nearest eye to my camera.&nbsp; What light there was, my 50-mil and a wide aperture setting took best advantage of and I left the crowded assemblage that day with this pleasing portrait.</p>\r\n<p>This same mosque offered numerous photo opportunities, regardless of the crowd and despite the lack of extensive light, therein.&nbsp; All I had to do was be able to move around a bit and to stay away from the corners of the room where hardly any light reached.&nbsp; The image of a male worshipper below is another example of just how well this lens performs in low light.&nbsp; In this composition, I again concentrated on the eyes (Reminder: If the eyes appear in sharp focus, the rest of the face will appear to be so too).&nbsp; This was an emotional day for these believers and this is what I most wanted to capture.&nbsp; The eyes of subjects I chose told it all.&nbsp; Take a \"technical\" look at this picture.&nbsp; The color palette is limited effectively to just a few closely-related hues, the subject is placed in a Rule-of-Thirds position (i.e. bottom left intersection of lines), background is thematically \"logical\" and supportive of the main subject, although softened to emphasize the subject.&nbsp; Besides this, there exists a subtle \"sense of moment\" in the man\'s emotional look at the camera.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the next photograph below I took to the streets of Kabul City.&nbsp; Doing street photography with a single camera body and 50mm lens attached, I came across this shopkeeper standing at his store-front window, gazing at the passing crowd of people (visible in reflection) near the main bazaar of the capital.&nbsp; No harsh light here.&nbsp; The day was overcast and the light was once again low.&nbsp; What caught my eye at first was the Persian writing on the window, basically announcing that the shop was open for business.&nbsp; I then saw the proprietor and set about from the sidewalk to \"construct\" a photograph.&nbsp; The man was entertained by my actions and became a contributing partner in the making of this picture.&nbsp; Now take a moment to analyze this photo.&nbsp; With my 50mm set to aperture f/2.8, I was able to include detail in both immediate foreground and my subject, and still be able to do it hand-holding at below 1/30 sec. (the speed below which hand-holding this focal length lens with insured sharpness, is not recommended).&nbsp; Composition here is basically Rule-of-Thirds, with the man being the subject.&nbsp; Color palette is limited to a few closely-related hues and a subtle sense of moment exists in the shop-owners look at the lens.&nbsp; An additional point to make is that I switched my lens from auto-focus to manual focus due to the presence of the glass.&nbsp; Oftentimes auto-focus mechanisms have trouble doing their job through glass, so it\'s a good idea to make the change before even attempting this kind of shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next photograph was made in the south of India, in a region called the \"Backwaters\" of the state of Kerala.&nbsp; This low-light situation is a dirt-floor kitchen of a very simple country \"restaurant.\"&nbsp; Stopping with my guide for lunch, I first noticed the shadow of a person moving about through the doorway to the backroom kitchen.&nbsp; I wandered in, held up my camera and received an excepting look from the cook spooning broth from one pot to another.&nbsp; It was so dark here in fact, that I probably wouldn\'t have gotten an acceptably sharp photo had it not been for a beam of sunlight streaming through a smoke-hole in the tin roof above.&nbsp; The filtered light and my 50mm lens dialed to a wide aperture were all that were needed when the subject walked by and looked skyward.&nbsp; Compositionally-speaking, this is again a \"simple\" photograph in design - single and defined subject, uncluttered and non-distractive background (soft-focus in this case, due to wide aperture setting) and limited color palette.&nbsp; As for a \"sense of moment\" to this shot there is one in the \"out-of-the-ordinary\" rays of light shinning down from \"the heavens.\"</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Northern India is the setting for this following low-light capture.&nbsp; I was at the Tibetan Children\'s Village nursery in the hill-station town of Dharamsala.&nbsp; This young girl, having been orphaned as a baby, was a resident here.&nbsp; Light was low in intensity and what light there was, it came sparingly through a small window at the end of the room.&nbsp; \"Simplicity\" - in background and colors - was once again the photographic draw for me in this situation.&nbsp; Children are in essence a lot like wildlife to photograph.&nbsp; Much patience is required to get a really interesting shot.&nbsp; I kept an eye on this child sitting by herself&nbsp; in the playroom and eventually walked her way, placing my camera on aperture-priority and setting a wide one (i.e. f/4.0) at that, to accommodate the light where she sat.&nbsp; I clowned around in front of her, but no response.&nbsp; Then as I was about to walk away, she raised her hand to her face and I auto-focused quickly on the eye behind.&nbsp; This was the \"moment\" and the kind of photograph I wanted to make.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Where almost no light for photography exists at all, even the light-gathering properties of the small and fast 50mm become stretched to their limits.&nbsp; In these situations, look for \"points of light\" as the main subject of your composition.&nbsp; In the photograph below, I \"zoomed in\" (with my feet, of course) to capture this frame-filling detail of a candle holder and its contents.&nbsp; A few \"camera craft\" details are in order here to describe exactly how this \"low-light-source-of-light\" picture was made.&nbsp; This candle and holder rested on a windowsill.&nbsp; Outside the light of dusk was already transitioning to the darkness of night.&nbsp; Had I photographed this scene from a meter or so away, my picture would have included a lot of non-essential / non-supportive context.&nbsp; Looking around the edges of my viewfinder, I took steps closer and closer to eliminate these elements as I went.&nbsp; A step away from this light source, I still had the metal of the window-frame in my picture, so I kept \"zooming\" up to the minimum focusing distance of my lens.&nbsp; I switched from auto-focus to manual focus, placed the white-balance of my digital slr to \"daylight\" in order to capture the golden richness of the flames and focused sharply on the candle-wick of the flame closest to me.&nbsp; I lastly adjusted my frame to include a reflection of one of the flames in the window background (a subject-supporting inclusion), braced myself as best I could and squeezed the shutter button to capture this subject-background combination at 1/15 of a second.&nbsp; The result is an atmospheric and romatic close-up that fills the frame with the warmth of candlelight.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 08:22:29','2015-03-23 08:29:32'),(147,47,'Going It Alone',NULL,'<p>If I were packing for an extended photo assignment and had just one lens in my bag - my 50, would I feel uncomfortable?&nbsp; Most likely, yes.&nbsp; But of course this would have more to do with my own insecurities than it would with the capabilities of this prime piece of optics.&nbsp; With the possible exceptions of photographing close-ups of a tiger (although this too might be possible through the bars at a zoo) or capturing \"kinetic\" action in a war zone, I know that I could reply on this lens (and my own feet) to produce a comprehensive body of work that would also have impact.&nbsp; In fact, I did this very thing when putting together this final lesson of the course.&nbsp; I went to the local zoo and concentrated on the tropical house with its low-light aspects and rich, vibrant colors.</p>\r\n<p>In this first photograph below, I used a life-like statue of a gorilla at the zoo\'s entrance to convey the feeling of \"humans\" entering a whole other life zone.&nbsp; For this shot I set a wide aperture of f1.4, positioned the statue within the frame to appear as if this \"sentry\" were keeping an eye on visitors passing through the gate.&nbsp; At first I thought to include the ape\'s whole head in my picture, but finally repositioned my viewfinder to place emphasis on his \"eye on the crowd,\" instead.&nbsp; The group of people walking into the background, although soft in focus, are supportive of the subject (the gorilla) in a logically-fitting way.&nbsp; I\'ve made the background so, to better have this group represent \"all visitors\" to the zoo.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Perspective (upward tilt of the camera) and juxtaposition of tropical foliage against a ceiling of modern pavilion architecture, create a pleasing graphic design in this next photograph - an intended \"wide-angle\" perspective.&nbsp; I slightly underexposed and repositioned my viewfinder a number of times to capture - just right - this particular view of the building containing a tropical biotope.&nbsp; I especially like this combination of diagonal building lines and the lace-like utline of foliage against it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>In this third photograph below I went again for a \"wide-angle\" view, this time tilting my camera upward on a central spiral stairway taking visitors into the rainforest canopy for a \"bird\'s-eye\" view.&nbsp; The more you practice with the 50 in mild \"wide-angle\" mode, the more you\'ll get a feel for just how to apply it effectively to interpret your subjects in this way.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>For the fourth photo of my zoo essay, I \"zoomed in\" to capture a tropical forest flower against a semi-soft sea of green.&nbsp; Notice my placement of this blossom within the frame - rule of thirds.&nbsp; Notice too that I\'ve used a moderately wide aperture setting to soften the background a little, placing additional emphasis on the colorful subject of this composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>A \"telephoto\" perspective fills the frame of this next shot - a stand of healthy bamboo.&nbsp; Main subject of this composition?&nbsp; It\'s actually the growth segment of the stalk on the right.&nbsp; I positioned it rule-of-thirds here, opened (widened) the aperture of my 50mm lens and positioned an out-of-focus foreground piece just to the left of it, to give the impression of \"stacked\" elements captured with a mild telephoto lens.&nbsp; As for light, it\'s fairly low.&nbsp; Color?&nbsp; Well, definitely green dominates the frame, creating color harmony throughout the picture.&nbsp; If there exists a sense-of-moment in this shot, it lies in the watery swirl of leaves washing the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>To capture the following photo, I climbed part way up the spiral canopy staircase myself. In this middle-distance and \"from above\" perspective, I\'ve attempted to characterize the people and interest associated with a visit to this lush and varied biotope.&nbsp; Main subject of this composition?&nbsp; I placed focus for it to be the brighly-colored (orange) child, standing partially on tip-toes and engaged with the scene in front of him. In composing this shot, I paid particular attention to placement of walkway lines through the frame.&nbsp; My intent here was to create a sense of \"vitality\" using strong diagonals against the natural curves of leaves and branches.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>In low light, the next capture required not only a near-macro zoom by the photographer, but a steady hand too in order to shoot this march of leaf-cutter ants.&nbsp; This wasn\'t so easy, considering I had to lean over the visitor barrier to reach the focal minimum-distance my lens would allow.&nbsp; I then awaited just the right number of ants carrying a recognizable size of leaf parts.&nbsp; With light being low, I needed the increased shutter speed to still my hand.&nbsp; The wide aperture (f1.4) favorably softened a distracting background to place greater attention on the tiny subjects crossing the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>A change of perspective marks this next, middle-distance photograph below.&nbsp; Now I am standing myself on the rainforest walkway, awaiting visitors to come into the frame I have chosen.&nbsp; The walkway handrails create a \"leading line\" into the picture and visitors approaching the camera.&nbsp; I didn\'t just photograph anyone here either.&nbsp; I waited for brightly-colored folks to add a \"splash\" to my compositions.&nbsp; I got it with this couple and woman dressed in red.&nbsp; Ok - so here as mentioned earlier are all the ingredients of a good photo - good, warm and even light, good color, good composition (basically rule-of-thirds) and .....&nbsp; well, what\'s missing?&nbsp; Right!&nbsp; Sense of moment isn\'t present.&nbsp; In this way, the photograph has informational \"content,\" but no real spirit of \"life.\"</p>\r\n<p>Now look at the second capture below this picture.&nbsp; I was patient and waited to see what would happen as this couple explored the scene in front of them.&nbsp; I focused sharply on the woman as she moved slowly in my direction, then watched and waited for something \"beyond the ordinary\" to happen.&nbsp; When the woman raised her hand to point something out - it did - and my \"sense of moment\" was in place.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>For this final image of my zoo essay, I zoomed \"out\" to include a scene-setting and contextual view overview of just where I\'d been shooting.&nbsp; I hand-held this shot at 1/15 second to include as much depth-of-field (at ISO 100), as possible.&nbsp; I wanted visitors in the scene of course and waited for this present group to pass.&nbsp; As subject of my composition, I placed the closest man in a near rule-of-thirds position in order to draw attention to him, as he walked into the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>I spent about two hours in the tropical house of my local zoo to make these photographs.&nbsp; The first 10 to 15 minutes of this time I spent simply walking around, thinking about just how I would approach my shoot - what I wanted to include in close-ups, where I wanted to position myself to capture visitors as they filed through the \"rainforest\" and where I would need to pay particular attention to hand-holding slow shutter speeds in low light.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>A 50mm prime lens has a lot to offer the photographer - all in one compact, light weight and relatively inconspicuous package.&nbsp; Its use can go a long way too to making one a much better photographer.&nbsp; It teaches \"discipline of the frame\" - the fact that you get what see when squeezing the shutter button.&nbsp; And if you want something different with this solitary piece of quality glass, you need to think thoroughly through your composition and move in or out - wherever - to capture it.&nbsp; That\'s what the 50mm has to offer - no more, no less.&nbsp; Make best use of its properties and apply them accurately and creatively to your own brand of photography.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 08:23:37','2015-03-23 08:34:24'),(148,50,'Taking Control',NULL,'<h6>What are your priorities? Deviating from \"proper\" exposure. Exploring the extremes.</h6>\r\n<p>When it comes to photography, there\'s a lot of emphasis placed on \"personal style\". Henri Cartier-Bresson, of course, had one; Annie Liebowitz certainly displays a distinctive style in her portrayals of celebrities and royals. In broadest terms, photographic style has to do with one\'s own vision and interpretation of the world, distilled in photographic terms. Its origins are part upbringing, part life experiences, coupled with a lot of practice &ndash; camera in hand. Two final ingredients add to the formula and both everyone has to some degree. These are a sense of design and a willingness to be creative.</p>\r\n<p>We\'ll start our exploration of personal photographic style not with a camera, but with your eyes and intuition, only. Gather an armful of your favorite journals and magazines and find a comfortable and quiet place where you can spread things out in front you. The aim of this exercise is to get a feel for the kinds of photographs you\'re already &ndash; consciously or subconsciously &ndash; most excited by. Discovering your natural inclinations toward certain types of photographic expression is an excellent point of departure for exploring directions in which your own photographic style might lie.</p>\r\n<p>As you page through these publications, set a marker at - or better yet, clip if you can - those pictures that most attract your attention. Don\'t labor over your choices. Be fast and intuitive. When you\'re done, place your \"selects\" side-by-side and begin noting their similarities. From what perspective were the majority of them shot? Are they predominantly wide-angle compositions or made with a medium to telephoto lens? If color, are the hues bold or subdued pastels? Are there people in these shots? If so, were these portrayals made in \"personal space\" or were they captured from an impersonal distance? Do the images you\'ve chosen display a degree of \"interpretation\" or are they strict \"documentary\" photographs? Once you\'ve completed this analysis, set your notes aside for the moment to begin the next part of this week\'s lesson &ndash; assuming creative control of your own camera.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the array of functions your model might possess, there are really only two &ndash; aperture and shutter speed &ndash; that form the \"bottom line\" of photographic expression. Together with the ISO (\"film\" speed) you set, these are the \"palette\" and \"brush\" with which you manipulate light to achieve the stylistic results you most desire.</p>\r\n<p>As you\'ll recall, a \"proper\" exposure for any given level of light is formed by a particular combination of aperture and shutter speed. The light meter in your camera gives you a \"recommended\" setting that is based on reflectivity from an 18-percent gray standard or \"middle\" gray, as its known. This is roughly the tonal quality of foliage, grass, bare earth, khaki cloth, tree trunks and tarmac.</p>\r\n<p>Aperture and shutter speed possess a reciprocal relationship to one another, meaning that as one is increased, the other is decreased, at a same interval. In so doing, the same ratio of one to the other is maintained, and so is the original exposure recommended by your in-camera light meter. And - it is from here that your primary grasp on creativity and compositional design transform.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s say, for instance, that your initial light meter reading is aperture f5.6 at shutter speed 1/125 second. Any shift in one of these controls requires an equal change in the opposite direction to the other, in order to maintain the same balanced exposure for that scene. Moving from f5.6 to f8, for example, means that you must reduce your shutter speed from 1/125 second to 1/60 second. An aperture adjustment from f5.6 to f11 requires that your shutter speed be reduced by two stops &ndash; from the original 1/125 second to 1/30 second. In this particular case, the photographer is favoring depth-of-field (that which lies in sharpest focus from foreground through background) over his or her ability to freeze action in the picture &ndash; a conscious and creative choice. Should freezing or blurring the action be the photographer\'s top priority, shutter speed adjustment would then take \"center stage\" at the expense of making your photo sharp throughout - foreground to background. You can have both - by setting a higher ISO, but you pay a price here, too. The higher an ISO setting becomes, the more digital \"noise\" (the more film \"grain\") you\'ll encounter. In the context of creativity and personal expression, the priority choice of one setting - shutter speed or aperture - over the other, is one of the most basic and powerful choices you\'ll have to make.</p>\r\n<p>In the two photos above, I reveal some of my creative choices and in so doing, a little about my own style as a photographer. To begin, I like to pack as much visual information into my compositions as possible. My lens of choice, therefore, is a wide angle, usually in the 16mm to 24mm range. I also work quite near to my subject (usually people), in an attempt to have the viewer feel - \"right there\" - next to what\'s taking place. From here, it\'s a matter of choosing which adjustment &ndash; aperture or shutter speed &ndash; to set first in order to achieve the expression and interpretation I most want.</p>\r\n<p>Made at a brickworks in the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, I set out in this first photo example below to emphasize the teamwork shown by this husband and wife, laboring together in one of the poorest countries in the world. Using my 24mm lens and placing the main subject in the immediate foreground of my composition, I set an ISO of 100 and an aperture of f16, to create a strong depth-of-field. In the bright morning light, I wanted to have both persons appear in sharpest focus. By using my aperture to this degree, I was able to visually strengthen the working relationship these two family members had. Positioning the two on a diagonal through the frame, added a dynamic dimension to the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>The next photograph is a composition in which I chose to emphasize motion over sharpness. Once again I used a 16 - 35mm zoom, set to about 24mm. My subjects were two groups of trekkers and porters, passing shoulder-to-shoulder - in opposite directions - during a snowstorm. My aim was to capture the silent \"haste\" these folks showed, as they made their ways across a mountain pass in the Karakorum Mountain Range of northern Pakistan. For this I set shutter speed first, placing it to 1/8 sec. My camera\'s ISO was once again set to 100, so as to maintain a tight grain pattern (keep digital \"noise\" low), throughout the frame. Under the low light conditions that prevailed that day, the f-stop setting (f4) I was forced to use in order to maintain adequate exposure, resulted in diminished depth of field and, consequently, additional blur throughout the frame. The result is \"apparition -like\", exactly the \"look\" I was after.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Reminder: Depth-of-field (DOF) becomes less as lens focal-length becomes greater. A 16mm wide-angle lens requires very little focal adjustment to obtain a sharp picture throughout. You can essentially just \"pull-up-and-shoot\". Everything will appear in sharpest focus from front to back. A 300mm lens on the other hand, needs very accurate adjustment to keep the subject within the range of sharp focus. That said, the area of sharp focus behind your subject becomes less the closer you come to it, and this holds true for lenses of any focal length.</p>\r\n<p>The degree of exposure you give your pictures can also be factored into the equation of photographic style. There are two ways to control this. The first is by altering either the aperture or shutter speed setting (but not both) from that recommended by your camera\'s light meter. The second is via the ISO setting you place on your camera (Note here that this is only possible, on a frame-by-frame basis, using digital cameras. With film, just which ISO to process at, becomes a complication). The effect to be achieved is totally up to you.</p>\r\n<p>A couple of \"stops\" of light separate the next two images.&nbsp; Neither is a \"proper\" exposure in the sense of being recommended by the camera\'s light meter. Both are deviations, thereof. Made with the primary intent of showing feet in motion ascending a staircase, shutter speed was the setting of choice in each. The under-exposed picture directly below, caused by reducing aperture (\"closing down\") by two stops (i.e. changing from f2.8 to f5.6), brings a solid \"heaviness\" to the photograph. The legs feel \"weighed-down\" and cumbersome. The over-exposed picture following it, made by \"opening up\" the aperture of my lens from f2.8 to f1.4 and effectively doubling the amount of light now striking the digital sensor of my camera, gave the picture a \"spirit-like\", floating quality, by comparison.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Lying still further in the search for a personal photographic style is the uncharted realm of experimentation. This is where a photographer applies all he or she knows of \"camera craft\" and allows the rest to be &ndash; well, just personally creative!</p>\r\n<p>The following photo represents my try at this. It was was made in Beirut, Lebanon during a nighttime memorial service held for the late Prime Minister, Rafic Hariri. Exemplary of the style I often show, this photo was produced at close distance with a wide-angle lens. Maintaining a low ISO setting of 100, I again selected a slow shutter speed of 1/8 sec., to give subject and background an \"ethereal\" cast. The combination of camera controls brought me lots of blur and in the presence of flickering candlelight, an ominously \"haunting\" effect. In the wake of fleeting allegations surrounding Hariri\'s assassination in February of 2005, this is the way I wanted to go.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>I\'m right on the heels of this Ladakhi nomad woman herding Kashmiri goats to morning pasture in the last picture below. I was after a less than pure documentary feel here. My aim was to meld animals and landscape into a swirl of earthy pastel colors, having this smiling woman be the focal point of my composition. To accomplish this, I made shutter speed my priority, placing it at a slow 1/8 sec. In the rising light of mid-morning, this allowed me a strong depth-of-field (f16) at ISO 100. The lens I used was 20mm and I made a series of photographs of this situation as it progressed just in front of me. Attendant in this process, was my desire to include as much contextual information as possible &ndash; all with a keen eye to effective composition and design. The resulting photograph is at once a lively and impressionistic glimpse of this pastoral folk amid their high-altitude environment and an experiment that - with persistence - paid off.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 15:21:30','2015-03-23 16:17:22'),(149,50,'Bending and Breaking Rules',NULL,'<h6>In the \"absence\" of composition. Creating &ldquo;edge&rdquo; and tension. Breaking the frame.</h6>\r\n<p>Although guidelines do exist regarding the placement of subject and elements within the photographic frame, &ldquo;composition&rdquo; has much to do with personal intuition and sense of design.</p>\r\n<p>Refresher: The so-called, &ldquo;Rule-of-Thirds&rdquo; guideline to composition below offers the photographer a basic reference for placement of the subject within the frame. Applying this is a simple matter of mentally dividing the viewfinder frame into thirds &ndash; both vertically and horizontally. The four intersections thus created are opportune points at which to position your subject/center-of-interest, in order to bring greater visual interest and balance in the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Remember when you first started taking pictures. If you were like most of us, you placed your subject smack-dab in the center of the frame. The result was a static shot with &ndash; most likely &ndash; a lot of unrelated elements and &ldquo;dead space&rdquo; surrounding it. Such is a \"photo-document\" to be sure, but not always the most stunning that could be.</p>\r\n<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t to say that the center of the photographic frame &ndash; no matter what format you&rsquo;re working in &ndash; doesn&rsquo;t have its place in &ldquo;good&rdquo; composition. That is, when you position the main subject precisely in the center of the frame, you are imbuing that subject with a sense of &ldquo;peacefulness, serenity, stasis and strength&rdquo;. This is the place for the &ldquo;timeless&rdquo; &ndash; the Taj Majal of India, the lifeless sails of a boat caught in the equatorial &ldquo;doldrums&rdquo;, the despot of a nation or the meditative stature of the Lord Buddha.</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the latter for a moment, consider the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the first and second photo examples below.&nbsp; Positioning of the Buddha statue exactly in the center of the first yields a sense of unchanging &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; and tranquillity. Moving the subject in any direction off-center, as in the second, dilutes this psychological message. Symmetry is gone and the \"imbalance\" that now exists brews a visual &ldquo;tension&rdquo; throughout the frame.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Moved clear to the edge of the frame, as in the following example, the feeling of unrest is intensified due to our innate desire for an \"orderly\" arrangement and the \"stilling\" effect it brings to us. Think of the situation as a gum band anchored to the center of the picture. As long as the elastic band remains completely in the center of the frame there is no tension, whatsoever. But once you begin to pull that center-attached rubber band in any direction, dynamic tension builds. The farther you stretch it &ndash; in any direction and right to the very edges of the frame &ndash; the greater the tension becomes. Placement of subjects has the same effect.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Another technique that can add to the stylistic interpretation of a scene and subject is creation of &ldquo;edge&rdquo;. By simply tilting the camera slightly from the horizontal plane or photographing from an oblique angle, you can deliver an element of &ldquo;agitation&rdquo; to your composition. In the next photograph below for instance, I photographed this trio of musicians in Tashkent, Uzbekistan from a somewhat overhead perspective, as well as at an angle. In short, I really \"torqued\" the camera about as far as I could without completely throwing the viewer off-balance. My goal was to accentuate the enthusiasm and positive body language of these female musicians caught in song, while inviting the viewer&rsquo;s eye to move in a circular fashion, about the composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The next picture places a combination of techniques into action in order to portray this Mayan Indian canoeist in southern Mexico, in a dynamic way. First by moving the subject to (and beyond) the right side of the frame, if &ldquo;stretched the rubber band&rdquo; to its limit, thus maximizing the feel of tension this man feels in his arms each time he paddles. My slight tilt of the camera from its horizontal axis was used to lend the effect of the boat dipping slightly to the side, as it is thrust forward by the man&rsquo;s powerful efforts. Placed together, the photograph expresses a &ldquo;kinetic energy&rdquo; that would not otherwise exist.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>The key to incorporating these techniques into your own photographic style is to apply them thoughtfully and &ldquo;delicately&rdquo;. Either or both are not always appropriately suited to all subjects. And it&rsquo;s easy to carry them too far, as well, leaving your composition with an &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; and extremely out-of-balance \"feel\" to it. Experiment with each and both together to gain a sense of just where your own limits lie.</p>\r\n<p>Not only can the &ldquo;what&rdquo; and &ldquo;where&rdquo; within the frame matter in terms of exploring the dimensions of one&rsquo;s personal photographic expression of style, so too can spreading the action clear to the edges &ndash; and beyond. Wherever there is pictorial &ldquo;inference&rdquo;, the viewer&rsquo;s imagination will follow. And, as many great photographers have said, the best and most memorable photographs happen not so much in the eye of the viewer, but in the mind of the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>Like horses corralled, the majority of pictures you see have their elements neatly and fully enclosed by the frame. Oftentimes, they don&rsquo;t even touch the frame, as if it were in some way electrified against it. The following photo example stands in counterpoint to this. This image, made in the city of Kandahar, in the south of Afghanistan, captures an American Independence Day celebration, where invited nationals performed a traditional group dance for the soldiers, as entertainment. I photographed the action close-up with a 24mm lens, positioned inside the circling procession and squeezing the shutter each time the moment seemed right. The result was raw-ish flow of energy, moving into my viewfinder, through it and out the other side - a continuous flow of motion with arms swinging and feet flying. And then it began again.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Visualize \"breaking the frame\" as a scene from a Hollywood ghost movie, wherein apparitions pass through solid walls and doors. Although you can&rsquo;t see it, you can almost imagine just how these forms appear - undisclosed - on &ldquo;the other side&rdquo;. This is the effect I was after and that which &ldquo;breaking the frame&rdquo; provides.</p>\r\n<p>One more example of this below comes from Afghanistan&rsquo;s capital, Kabul, this time. The scene is Ashura, a primarily Shia Muslim day of mourning for the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Outside a mosque in the city stood a pole bearing the holy flag of Islam, which believers thronged to touch it to their foreheads. I assumed a place immediately in front of the advancing crowd and made a number of photographs with a 16mm lens, as people filed by. Due to my proximity and the sheer size of the group, nearly every composition overflowed the frame with people on the move. That which laid beyond - part in, part outside the frame - was for the mind to decide.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 16:21:03','2015-03-23 16:21:03'),(150,50,'Letting the Ghost Run Free',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Learning the process. Hollywood nights. Experimentation and results.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>There are times when &ldquo;straight forward&rdquo; photography falls short of conveying the action and energy of a particular scene. There are times, too, when one&rsquo;s own skills with a camera are in need of a boost of expression. In both instances, a creative combination of shutter speed, ambient light and a small amount of flash can be just the solution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Oftentimes referred to as, &ldquo;<em>flash-ghosting</em>&rdquo;, because of the &ldquo;aura of light&rdquo; produced around the flash-illuminated subject, with a full motion blur, the technique is easy to apply and can stretch your style of shooting with stunning results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Photographing at a traditional wrestling school in Old Delhi, India a few years ago, I was challenged to come up with something that spoke more dramatically of the action occurring in the dirt ring in front of me. Closely following these two wrestlers with a 35mm lens attached to my camera, I decided to attached a small flash to the hot-shoe of my camera is see just what the result might be. Having a flash with the ability to incrementally reduce the amount of light output, I set it exactly one-half the full amount. I then set an ISO of 100 and a shutter speed of 1/15 second. In the moderately low light of the wrestling arena, this gave me an aperture of f 4 to work with in the ambient light. I kicked off my shoes, rolled up my pant legs and did my best to follow the action. One of the images that resulted was that shown below, a tightly composed photo displaying a definite &ldquo;sense of moment&rdquo; in the controlling wrestler&rsquo;s look and all the qualities I was after in the ghosting affect produced.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next photo represents still another demonstration of flash-ghosting. For this shot, though, I stood a distance to capture this Tibetan woman spinning a Buddhist prayer-wheel in the north Indian town of Dharamsala. Context was very important here, so I positioned myself using a 35mm lens to capture the woman in just the right position and with the right amount of context surrounding her.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>In terms of available light, this situation was different from that of the previous example. Here I shot into a windowless room, illuminated by only a small number of weak incandescent and colored lights. I took my light-meter reading from a middle tone (&ldquo;18% gray&rdquo;) of the scene, which happened to be the green of the prayer-wheel. I focused on the rim of wheel by which people turned it in clockwise rotation, stood near the open doorway and waited for a &ldquo;subject&rdquo; to enter. She finally did and crouched down and braced myself against the doorframe, seeking to fire my flash placed on full power and handhold my camera set for existing ambient light, at aperture f2.0 and a shutter speed of one-eighth of a second. When the devout woman reached the point of the scene on which I focused most sharply, I squeezed the shutter, putting my flash-ghosting combination into operation. The result was much better than I&rsquo;d expected. The quite low shutter speed, mixed with the minimal amount of light filtering into the tiny room, blended with an array of bright colors, brought the ghosting I was after - and a touch of the &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo;, too.</p>\r\n<p>Hollywood filmmakers have always been among the first to devise ways to alter our sensibilities as movie-goers. One of the first &ndash; and still used &ndash; means of doing this is to use extreme under-exposure to bring &ldquo;night time&rdquo; to pictures. From just which camera setting is this achieved? Aperture is the usual means, unless action blur is part of your plan, too. By how much should one reduce aperture to gain the desired effect? Well, this part is completely up to you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Following is a photography made at a U.S. airbase in the south of Afghanistan. Time-wise, the setting of the shot was about five in the afternoon. The sun was just about to disappear below the horizon when I began to photograph the &ldquo;Predator&rdquo; drone aircraft stationed there. Filming would have been fine &ndash; very dramatic, in fact &ndash; had I photographed the situation, \"as is\". My aim, though, was to make a photograph that was even more \"theatrical\" and ominous! I set my camera on a tripod and requested that the hanger lights be switched on. Military personnel working there we\"re very accommodating and I began to shoot away. I began by setting exposure for the scene in accordance to the so-called, \"Sunny-16 Rule\". That is, I placed my shutter speed to a setting that most closely approximated the ISO value currently dialed-in on my camera - ISO 100. This returned a suggested aperture setting from my light meter, of f4.0. From this base-line exposure combination, I reduced (under-exposed) my aperture a full two stops further - to f8. Continuing on, I reciprocally changed exposure until I reached a final aperture of f22 and a corresponding shutter speed of 1/8 sec. I then began to make pictures. The result was a maximum depth-of-field and an exposure that satisfyingly resembled the late twilight hours of the day.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>A similar treatment befell the scene of brick workers in the next picture below.&nbsp; Here they are shown collected for a group portrait atop the kiln they work daily.&nbsp; The locale is the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal and many of these laborers, ranging in age from those in their thirties and forties to young boys down the age of 12 and 13. Time of day was mid-morning. So why did I choose &ldquo;darkness&rdquo;? I wanted faceless silhouettes, lean forms cast against the backdrop of an air-polluting smokestack. I used a tripod here too, positioning it down low with a 20mm lens arranged to portrait (vertical) format for added accentuation of all the vertical forms. I then established a base-line meter reading, placing shutter speed at 1/125 sec., as my priority setting. This gave me a corresponding aperture of f8, from which to begin the photographic plunge to darkness. Once more I reduced aperture (under-exposed) by a full three stops, taking me to maximum depth-of-field at aperture f22. Shutter speed remain unchanged at 1/125 sec. My final act of composition was to move camera position enough to place the sun directly behind the plumes of smoke, thus highlighting the air-pollution factor in all of this. I then made the shot as it appears here.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Yet another exposure method that can extend your photographic voice, involves the application of a small amount of fill-flash (flash power dispensed in reduced and balanced amounts) combined with the technique of panning, or focusing on and following a moving subject with your camera. I did this in the following photo example made while photographing Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Making her hurried way with bodyguards in tow through a crowd, there wasn&rsquo;t my room for a casual or outwardly stunning shot of this woman, so I quickly made the decision to apply this technique in the hopes of making something exciting from what would, otherwise, been quite dismal photographically. I clicked on my 35mm lens, dialled my on-camera flash unit to one-half power, secured an ambient exposure reading, elbowed my way to the front of the press conglomeration and swung and shot with Mrs. Merkel as she sped by. In the several frames I got off, I was most pleased with this result &ndash; and a &ldquo;sense-of-moment&rdquo; smile, to boot!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Another excellent application of this &ldquo;fill-flash &ndash; swing-and-shoot&rdquo; method is in the harsh light of midday sun, probably &ldquo;the&rdquo; worst time to attempt any type of photography. Oftentimes, though, you simply have no choice. The event is in full-swing, the subject is there &ndash; no choice but to deal with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Just such an occasion &ndash; a noon-time rally of Tibetan Buddhist monks in the extra-clear mountain heights of northern India - is represented in the next photo. I followed alongside this parade of perhaps thirty monks, as they made their through the village streets. Checking each time what I had captured before hurrying on, I saw only bright highlights and deep, dark shadows as I ran through my shots on the back of my digital SLR. Then I decided to deal with it all from a more creative perspective. Pulling my flash from the bag, I once more curbed its output and even reduced (underexposed) the ambient exposure recommended by my camera&rsquo;s light meter. Shuffling along the red, candle-bearing procession, I clicked away just a few feet (a meter or so) from the monks. The fact that I was panning somewhat faster than the group&rsquo;s movement, accounts for the degree of blur I received. All-in-all, this was my most successful shot from the take &ndash; still lots of bright streaks of sunlight in the background, but it only adds to the visual &ldquo;momentum&rdquo; and flair of the event.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 16:24:28','2015-03-23 16:24:28'),(151,50,'The World According to - YOU!',NULL,'<h6><em>\"ID-ing\" that feeling or idea. Setting course. Unveiling your vision.</em></h6>\r\n<p>It\'s early evening and I\'m riding on an overnight Indian train bound for the Taj Mahal city of Agra. I look over to the next seat where students of mine are dialing through recently-made photographs on their digital camera monitors. The eight of us are on the last leg of an on-location workshop that has pushed limits and reset comfort zones, as far as photography and foreign experience are concerned. Colors, cultures, peoples - all have been worlds different from the subjects most of these folks have made pictures of until now. Critiquing daily \"takes\" of their work has given me a familiarity with each student\'s approach to photographic expression and has allowed me to see just how each has progressed since the day we started - an exciting and work-packed week-and-a-half ago. More interesting still, have been incremental, but solid steps toward the emergence of what could honestly be called a personal \"style\" - even in so short a time.</p>\r\n<p>An initial step in assessing the feeling or emotion one has about any subject - anywhere, is to identify just why it was that one\'s eyes were halted for a \"second look,\" in the first place. It may have had to do with color alone. Bright colors do grab the eye and I could see this happening often among students with me in India. No question about it - many places can be described in terms of their colors and bright colors are \"eye-stoppers\".</p>\r\n<p>But color alone can\'t carry a photograph. There must be something more - and often when you do dig deeper into your thoughts and feelings surrounding a subject, you find it. Take for instance the first photograph below, captured in the north Indian town of Mcleod Ganj. It is here that His Holiness the Dalai Lama resides, alongside a thriving community of exiled Tibetan followers. Now, admittedly it was the strong red context of this scene that first drew my attention. Knowing too at the time that the color red represents fire and power in the Tibetan Buddhist constellation of beliefs, I began to photographically explore the delicacy and passion with which this artist applied his skills to his project. It was not simply work this young man was involved with, he was depicting a philosophy - a belief system in every stroke of his brush and this is precisely what I set out to capture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>My own style as a photographer can first be described in focal-length terms - \"wide angle.\" I tend to see the world in broad-view and in close-up terms. And these are the kinds of images - mine and those of other photographers - that attract my attention the most. It is for this reason that I set out to portray the young artist above as \"middle-point\" of this composition, surrounded by the instruments of his trade - jars of paint, brushes, all with the color red harmoniously laced throughout.</p>\r\n<p>Let me give you several more examples of how I personally go about identifying thoughts, feelings and emotions surrounding particular subjects that I photograph. In the next image, I sought to convey the breadth and peacefulness of the Golden Temple - \"Mecca\" of the Sikh religion - in the Indian state of Punjab. I made the Sikh guard - dressed in traditional costume - the \"subject\" of this picture, positioning him off-center, in the immediate foreground of the frame. I set an extensive depth-of-field of f16 on my wide-angle lens (16mm) and focused one-third of the way into the scene, to approximate a \"hyper-focal distance\" setting. The latter ensured optimum sharpness throughout the frame. Other elements I wanted to include in this picture, were the bather (left of guard) cleansing himself of sins and the Golden Temple itself, appearing in the background.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The next couple of photographs below speak to the generosity of this religion and its followers, evidenced here in the preparation and sharing of food at the Sikh temple or \"Gudwara\", as they\'re called, in Amritsar, India. This particular one, as part of the expansive Golden Temple complex, serves approximately 45,000 meals to believers each day. Meals are prepared and served around the clock by an organization of volunteers from within the congregation and my aim was to capture the fast-paced action of this ongoing event.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>To do this, I first surveyed the entire scene, noting just which \"stations\" of food preparation and distribution would offer me the kind of \"raw\" energy I most wanted to bring to my pictures. As for camera controls, I set shutter speed first to a slow 1/8 sec. Judging from the speed at which things seemed to be moving, I felt that this would give just enough blur, while still being able to retain good, recognizable definition in my subjects. At ISO 100, such shutter selection resulted in a corresponding aperture of f4 to f5.6, for most shots made under-roof, throughout the dining hall.</p>\r\n<p>Once I had sorted out just how this system operated, I positioned myself to begin. Beyond this \"structure\", I had no hard and fast plan in mind, leaving myself and subjects open to whatever would happen. The first of these two images above depicts exactly this approach philosophy. I saw that runners would carry pails of lentils to waiting diners every fifteen minutes or so. I positioned myself - crouched down to accentuate my subjects by shooting upwards - near to the \"flight-line\" of action and squeezed the shutter as servers rushed by.</p>\r\n<p>The second of these two pictures above represents a similar process of capture. I saw that volunteers were collecting plates and eating utensils near the exit of the complex. Lighting here was much better, but I stayed with 1/8 sec to continue my chosen shooting style for the project. This, as you can see, gave me quite a bit more depth of field and visible context in the background. Using a 24mm lens and standing at eye-height, I photographed these two men as they received emptied plates from satisfied diners, filing out of the area. Again, I simply pulled up my preset camera and squeezed the shutter each time arms were outstretched for the task of taking.</p>\r\n<p>The world I\'ve come to photograph in recent years has been an increasingly Asian and Middle-Eastern one. Has my own photographic approach and manner of interpretation changed because of this? Undoubtedly. Style is a constantly evolving thing, but the way I make pictures there or anywhere else, is always a compilation of personal knowledge, experiences and who I innately am inside. You don\'t simply replace one \"phase\" with another. All are a blend of each and this holds strongly for photography. The remaining two photographs here reflect this. Both are a quest for simplicity and the visual power that such most often conveys.</p>\r\n<p>Made in an Islamic school, the following photo example is meant to portray this young girl studying the Koran, in a graceful and peaceful manner. Upon gaining her acceptance to do so, I moved close with my 24mm lens. I placed my subject near the center of the frame to aid my interpretation. Aperture I set at a modest f5.6, in order to retain the classroom context, but in softer focus (Remember: The closer you are to your subject, the less will be in sharp focus behind that subject). I readied myself as this girl continued to read and at the last moment, I softly said, \"hello\". With this, she looked at the camera in a warm and impromptu way, giving me a \"sense-of-moment\" in the shot and exactly the \"feel\" I was after, throughout the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Made in Kazakhstan, Central Asia, the following final image is yet another reference to the simplicity of composition, my way of shooting has gravitated to. Once again, there is but a single subject, a key center-of-interest in the boy paddling about this holiday lake scene. The background is but one - water, and the color palette is minimal, limited to the refreshing tones of a hot summer\'s day. There exists a sense-of-moment here in the splash of water brought by kicking feet and the swimmer\'s presence is enhanced by the \"frame\" of another swimmer\'s figure, about to enter the water.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>As I\'ve tried to emphasize here and throughout the course, the presentation of one\'s vision of the world - the development of a photographic \"style\" - is an entirely personal thing. It may be added to, refined through experimentation, learning and experience, but it should never be replaced by the ways of others who make pictures. A photographic style only reaches maturity when the work is your own - honestly driven by exploration, understanding and practice. I wish you the best of luck in discovering yours!</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-23 16:27:09','2015-03-23 16:28:08'),(152,51,'Fundamentals of Interiors Photography',NULL,'<p><strong>There is no doubt that the number of blogs, magazines and books written about Interiors is vast, global and ever increasing.</strong> <br /><br />My passion for photography started at a young age, but how exactly did I become an Interiors photographer? This journey started out by taking a course in India with, David Bathgate and once I returned to London I decided to put a plan in place, to become a&nbsp;full-time&nbsp;professional photographer. Through a series of bizarre&nbsp;consequences, I ended up being given a photographers number and told to call him as he was looking for an assistant. As it transpires this photographer was in semi-retirement and not looking for an assistant, but swayed by my sheer determination and enthusiasm decided to take me on. He&nbsp;hadn\'t&nbsp;even looked at my work. He happened to be an Interiors photographer&nbsp;working freelance for one of the finest magazines titles - The World of Interiors.<br />&nbsp;<br />I have fortunately always had an interest in Interiors, due in part to my mother, who herself is an interior designer and would&nbsp;renovate the house we lived in, before finding the next project to renovate. I am by nature, naturally curious&nbsp;and want to peek through peoples windows and discover what&rsquo;s going on behind closed doors.<br />&nbsp;<br />So, my journey to becoming a photographer began, armed with a medium format camera of which to this day I still use to do all my Interior work.<br />&nbsp;<br />So what are the fundamentals of understanding Interiors and how to shoot them? Firstly Interiors are great subjects to photograph for a number of reasons, whether it is to capture a memory, a childhood moment or documenting something that will&nbsp;perhaps no longer be there in given time. It can be used to photograph&nbsp;furnishings, artwork or&nbsp;promote the sale of your home, a bed and breakfast and to create a reportage for a magazine.</p>\r\n<p>Even with Interiors your pictures should tell a story. When I shoot for magazines it is important that they understand the layout of the house / apartment as the reader&nbsp;and editor have obviously not visited. That does not mean that you need to photograph everything, but the photographs should be able to guide the reader around the house. This basic concept can be used when selling a house as well.<br />&nbsp;<br />It is important to understand what you are shooting and why you are shooting it. What is the subject? Is it the way the room is laid out, is it the fireplace or the objects of art? It is important to capture the essence of the room as a whole and then you can always go in for a detailed shot afterwards. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to walk around the room and shoot it from different angles, especially if you don&rsquo;t feel that it is quite right. I was told that if there is doubt, there is always doubt and once I started believing in myself this theory held out.<br />&nbsp;<br />Remember your audience, are you shooting to sell a house? Are you shooting to show off a designers work, or are you shooting for family memories? This will also help you in understanding where to shoot from.<br />&nbsp;<br />One example is this. Last year I photographed a lovely home in the South of England where the owner wanted to promote her new line of knitwear for children. She also did decorating projects which essentially sold the story as her house was so beautifully decorated. In this case I made sure to photograph samples of the work within the Interior story. Not only was the house good but the subject was too.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>I tend to photograph a lot of artists and their work as they make interesting subjects. It&nbsp;doesn\'t&nbsp;mean to say that their house is always that strong but sometimes&nbsp;the subject can be stronger than the Interior and therefore will sell for that reason.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>A few technical pointers:</strong></p>\r\n<p>As I work with a medium format camera all my Interior work is done on a tripod. I also suggest you do the same thing. I shoot all my photographs at F22 so that everything is in focus. Unless you are doing an arty shot, magazines do not want to have half the room blurred. People want to see everything in the photograph. Therefore having a tripod is essential for me as I tend to have long exposures.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another important point in shooting Interiors is the angles. You have to be careful of your horizontal and vertical lines otherwise the room will look drunk.&nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot always count on the walls to be straight either, especially in old houses! This is also another reason for working with a tripod.<br />&nbsp;<br />When I arrive for a shoot, I always take the time to walk around the house and get a feel for the place and it&rsquo;s essential to see how the light moves around the rooms - It is almost one of the first questions I ask, as I work with natural lighting only.</p>\r\n<p>Too much light that comes through the window will create harsh shadows and play havoc with exposure. Never shoot directly into sunlight. This we will discuss further in the second assignment when we talk more about lighting and styling.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br />&nbsp;<br />When you are looking at the composition of your photograph, it is interesting to look for shots that are graphic. I like to shoot through doors which gives the impression of looking into something. Mirrors are always good to use but be careful that you don&rsquo;t see your reflection!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-24 15:44:58','2015-03-24 15:44:58'),(153,51,'Styling and Lighting the Scene and Subject',NULL,'<p>This second assignment is split up into two parts as the title suggests. Let&rsquo;s start with Styling.<br />&nbsp;<br />Many photographers who work for magazines work with stylists and this has become quite an important job now. There are also photographers who do both. I have learnt to do both. I remember when I first started trying to place a tea towel in a photograph - I must have moved it 20 times to make sure it was in the right position with the right folds etc. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be that complicated!<br />&nbsp;<br />Styling is something that becomes instinctive. It is also something that can send you potty - moving an object a little bit to the right, then to the left and then back again to its original position. Other times you need to look into the camera and just move an object because in real life it looks fine. For example a table setting, but when you look in the camera you just need to move an object so that it looks better in the picture.<br />&nbsp;<br />Styling can be necessary if you&rsquo;re trying to promote a product, object or simply that certain things need to be removed or added to enhance the room you are shooting. I generally like to move as little as possible, although sometimes rooms need to be de-cluttered.<br />&nbsp;<br />A good example would be kitchens. There is no need to show all the cumbersome electrical gadgets. However, with rental properties, you may need to add personal objects to give a more lived in feeling - books, flowers, fruit etc&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Little details are important like making sure pictures and lampshades, or candles are straight. There is nothing worse than a wonky lampshade or picture unless intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;I always where ever possible try to hide electrical plugs and wires. This isn&rsquo;t always possible and that&rsquo;s where Photoshop comes in to play.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Secondly is the subject of Lighting, which I have briefly touched on already.&nbsp;&nbsp;I work with natural lighting. This means understanding how the light turns in the house in order to know when the best moment to shoot is.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should stay away from an overly bright window, as it can lead to exposure problems. You should as a rule keep windows off to the side. You should never really photograph into bright light and wherever possible photograph without using indoor lighting, which has a habit of changing the colour of the room.<br />&nbsp;<br />Most photographers would choose not to shoot on a dreary day, but I generally find that if it&rsquo;s overcast you get a&nbsp;good even light in the rooms, which makes it easier to photograph.&nbsp;&nbsp;This also helps with the issue of windows and sunlight. I compensate for the lack of light with long exposures.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br />&nbsp;<br />Ambient lighting is also another way of creating a different atmosphere to your rooms. For a wintery shot, doesn&rsquo;t it look better with a fire&nbsp;in a room? The trick behind this is not to light a real fire, which runs the risk when using a long exposure, to look like the whole room is on fire! All you need is a bit of newspaper screwed up in a ball and placed behind the logs. Let this burn a little and then take the picture. This will give the effect of a roaring fire but not a room on fire.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}<br />&nbsp;<br />The benefits of using my medium format camera is that I am able to take off the back, wind on the camera and put the film back on, giving me the ability to do double exposure shots. I sometimes do this when I am using candles in my shot. The same thing as with fires &ndash; a long exposure with candles can sometimes give the impression that the room is on fire.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}<br />&nbsp;<br />You can do the same thing with LED lights and indeed normal lights. I have a term &lsquo;on + off&rsquo; - unless the switch is right by me, I do need the help of an assistant, who switches the lights on for a couple of seconds and then off again. You can see the lights but it doesn&rsquo;t alter the colour in the room. Here are some examples below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<br />&nbsp;<br />It is also interesting to photograph the same room during different times of the day. The change in colour and ambience can be quite surprising. Take a look at this room that I took in Mali. Its outside but you can see the difference as the light changes towards the end of the day.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-24 15:47:44','2015-03-24 16:08:01'),(154,51,'Still Life and Portraits',NULL,'<p>I am also going to split this lesson into two categories: Still Life and Portraits.<br />&nbsp;<br />Let&rsquo;s start with Still Life. I love doing detailed shots or compositions. For me there are two ways of doing this. Firstly where the scene has been created by yourself, by putting objects together, the second being a scene that already exists in the house you have photographed and you are taking a close up shot of this.<br />&nbsp;<br />Detailed shots are always nice to add to the reportage. You need wide angle shots which best explain the room and then detailed shots which enhance the article, and are great fill in shots that perhaps focus on a collection of objects or details of a bed (see example below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}<br />&nbsp;<br />In this scene, the whole set up has been created in the kitchen. I.e. the placing of ceramic pots and vegetables.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br />&nbsp;<br />In the example below, the photograph to the left is a mise-en-scene in a house and all I did was ask the owner to write something on the chalk board. It was the magical finishing touch! With the photograph on the right, I just concentrated on the composition of the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br />&nbsp;<br />My home has an abundance of objects that I have found in flea markets and the French brocantes (antique markets). I look for things that I think will be useful for shoots and objects that I also feel will make great compositions. This ranges from old typewriters, books, old linens and postcards. Here is an example of what I have done at home&nbsp;from items found:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Moving onto Portraits:</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Many&nbsp;magazines now want portraits of owners. The reader is interested in seeing who the owner is. Some of the owners are quite reticent about doing this, but I have created a way of taking portraits that is alike to a 19th century painting. The exposures tend to be long, although I don&rsquo;t work at F22 for my portrait work. This means that the sitter tends to have to pose without moving, which creates quite a dignified portrait. I use the surrounding interior to create the portrait, while still retaining importance in the composition &ndash; this also becomes part of the composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<br />&nbsp;<br />There are different ways of doing portraits. Family photographs can be captured within the environment of a home, which can later evoke memories of childhood or specific family moments. It&rsquo;s a documentation of a time, a moment, a home, or even a hotel that you stayed in.<br />&nbsp;<br />There are now a lot of lifestyle portraits used by magazines. Editors like to have images of the owners doing things like walking down the stairs, playing with the children or an artist working (see below). Here in essence, you need to not only think about your background but what&rsquo;s behind the subject (you don&rsquo;t want a branch coming out of their head), what is the subject doing and where are they in the frame of the photograph?</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>When shooting portraits inside, be careful of the lighting. Wherever possible try and choose a spot that is quite luminous. Be aware of shadows on faces. You can always use a reflector or lights to take portraits.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-24 15:49:16','2015-03-24 16:10:08'),(155,51,'Presentation of Your Interiors Layout',NULL,'<p>When I show my reportages to an editor, I usually show between 15-25 photographs which will include all elements of the reportage, but not always an outside shot or a garden, although this can help, but it must include the kitchen, sitting room, dining room, bathroom, bedroom and more often than not a portrait. I also add a short description of the owner, be it an artist, decorator or architect. The Editor is firstly drawn in by the photographs and secondly by who the owner is. For example when I work for a certain English newspaper they always want a British element, be it the owner or where the house is. In reality, if they decide to print the reportage around 8-10 photographs are chosen.</p>\r\n<p>This final lesson is about pulling together all the elements you have learnt to create a mini reportage. Whether it&rsquo;s at your house, someone else&rsquo;s or even a bed and breakfast that you know of. If possible, I suggest shooting something you haven&rsquo;t already done. This will help put your new found skills to practice.<br />&nbsp;<br />Remember to take wide angle shots of rooms, as this will help the reader understand the house. Take detailed shots as discussed and put to good use the styling and lighting skills you have learnt to create ambient shots, but try not to overdo it!</p>\r\n<p>Finally you should have a portrait of the owners or family. If it&rsquo;s a bed and breakfast or something similar, perhaps a lifestyle shot of someone laying the table or making a bed.<br />&nbsp;<br />Bring all these elements together and label your photographs in order. Lead us through the house so that we can get an understanding of what we are seeing. I suggest a mini reportage of around 8-10 photographs.</p>\r\n<p>Again, when choosing your subject, think why you are taking these photographs.&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a look at some of my Interior reportages, please take a look at my site:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.joannamaclennan.com\"><strong>www.joannamaclennan.com</strong></a> - this should give you a guideline.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-24 15:50:50','2015-03-24 16:12:37'),(156,52,'Highlights and Shadows',NULL,'<p>Color is so integral to the human visual experience that most people don\'t or can\'t separate it in their mind\'s eye from everything else going on in a scene. To make a powerful or even good black-and-white image, a photographer must learn to visualize a scene she or he is photographing without the color and photograph it for it\'s gradations of light, it\'s contrast, and it\'s graphic elements.</p>\r\n<p>This photograph of the Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA is an example of photographing in color. When converted to black-and-white, the image doesn\'t really tell the story of that moment because I photographed and developed it with mainly color and composition in mind. You can see the simple black-and-white conversion of that image doesn\'t have as much of an impact on you as the color version does, as witnessed in the photo comparison below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Black-and-white photographers often talk about being able to \"see\" in black and white rather than color. Learning to \"see\" in black and white is also a question of learning how color is represented by grey tones and becoming more aware of the formal elements of composition that relate to black and white: line, shape, form, texture and pattern. Without color shade and shape play a more important role. Black-and-white photographs are representative and don\'t attempt to recreate the look of the real world. This is their artistic power and challenge.</p>\r\n<p>This first image below of a cliff in Pilar, New Mexico, USA, is an example of an image visualized for a black-and-white photograph. The black-and-white conversion of it that follows is more striking and tells the story of the shape and light of the scene better than the color version.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />To help themselves to see in black-and-white some photographers of the past would use reflecting surfaces made from obsidian - a black volcanic glass. These obsidian mirrors didn\'t show the color of the reflected scene, just line and shape. A piece of shiny black plastic could be used as a modern equivalent. There are also viewing filters, with a string to hang them around your neck made by companies such as Tiffen that can be used to help you see how things would look in a monochrome image. The Tiffen #1 Viewer for black-and-white imaging is available from a number of online photographic suppliers. Closing one eye and scrunching the eyelid of your other one can also be useful for this. This removes stereo vision to produce a flatter, more two-dimensional view. It also inhibits color vision and helps give a feel for the contrast in a scene.</p>\r\n<p>Digital imaging is a color capture technology, putting the creation of a black and white image now into the post-capture process. It is tempting to apply a quick digital black-and-white conversion to an image as a quick trick to make an image look interesting or give it a feeling of nostalgia or \"artiness\". This will lead to less than great results other than the occasional lucky moments. It is still very important to decide before you capture an image whether or not you are photographing for black and white or for color. Ansel Adams called this previsualisation; picturing the finished black-and-white print at the time you press the shutter. This helps you get the best out of any chosen scene in terms of shadow and highlight capture. It also means becoming more responsive to tone, texture and shape - the very aspects that make monochrome photography the great expressive medium that it is.</p>\r\n<p>Practice \"seeing\" in black-and-white. Spend this week looking at possible photographic subjects with black-and-white eyes. Use a piece of shiny black plastic or plexiglass, try a black-and-white viewing filter, or the technique of closing one eye and scrunching the other to help you remove color and flatten the scene before you to imagine what it will look like in 2 dimensions and without color. A good pair of polarized sunglasses can also work if you\'ve got them. When you have a scene that you think will make a good black and white image photograph it.</p>\r\n<p>Many of the same general tips on how to compose or frame a good shot apply just as well to black-and-white photography as in color. The most obvious difference is that with black-and-white you don\'t have the option of leading the eye around the image or evoking emotion with color. Thus we are working to train the eye to look at shapes, tones and textures in your frame. Pay particular attention to shadows and highlights that create contrast to lead the eye around the image and elicit response to your photograph.</p>\r\n<p>Photograph in RAW if your camera has that ability. If you don\'t have RAW ability then just photograph in the camera\'s regular color photo mode with the highest resolution you can. With both RAW and JPEG images you will then use the basic black and white conversion with whatever software you have to do that. You won\'t be doing any adjustments to the images beyond the very basic conversion. Let me know what you will be using. If you have trouble you can send them as color and we will still be able to work. I will be able to see them as black and white.</p>\r\n<p>While many cameras offer you an option of \"monochrome mode\" or \"black-and-white mode\" these limit your control over the end results when we get to more advanced levels of working with black and white. So it is best to get used to working with all the information to begin with. If you are shooting in RAW you can set the camera also on black-and-white mode so that you see the results on your camera LCD in black-and-white, but the camera actually records all the information of the scene including color.</p>\r\n<p>The most important part of this first lesson is what the famed American landscape photographer, Ansel Adams, called previsualization of your black and white image and learning to \"see\" in black-and-white.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 10:22:12','2015-03-25 13:26:44'),(157,52,'The Digital Camera Perspective',NULL,'<p>In Lesson One we began to explore seeing in black-and-white and visualization of a photograph before clicking the shutter. Hopefully you have started to see the difference in the worlds of black-and-white photography and color photography and actual human perception of a scene. The world of the photograph is different than the world we live in and even further from our \"reality\" is the world of black-and-white imagery. It\'s a bit of a journey down Alice In Wonderland\'s rabbit hole into a sometimes confusing and disorienting yet highly interesting world full of many possibilities.</p>\r\n<p>Let us now begin to more often refer to black-and-white images as \"grayscale\" because in reality they are not just black-and-white, they are many shades of gray or \"tones\". There are actually 256 tones of gray in the complete gray scale that the trained human eye can detect. You can think of these tones and our practice of them a bit like notes of a musical scale. All the many separate musical notes can be blended together to create a song. The notes you choose in your song and how you combine those notes depend on the thoughts or feelings that you want to express. This is the same for the tones or shades of gray that you use in your image and how they are combined. As I\'ve already said, interesting and quite endless in terms of possibilities! Let\'s not get ahead of ourselves though.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s pause here and discuss a few basics of how your camera sees light, the world of grayscale light, what sort of conditions lend themselves to grayscale over color and how you can best set your camera to take in the scene before you.</p>\r\n<p>For one, your eyes and brain see things in 3D. The camera sees and creates a 2D image. The photographic image has set borders defining what is included and what is not, slight turns of our head or shifts of our eyes and eye focus that we aren\'t necessarily aware of give us a more dynamic and fuller view. We view the world from many different points of view that we aren\'t necessarily aware of because we take them for granted, by means of our stereo or binocular vision (two eyes) and continuous movement of head, eyes and body. The brain synthesizes this into a complete visual experience that the camera can\'t convey when it records one single two-dimensional view.</p>\r\n<p>Secondly, digital camera sensors aren\'t able to see as broad a range of light as the human eye. This range of light is called dynamic range - the range of brightness between the brightest light in a scene and the least bright light in a scene. So on days that are overcast, there is a lower dynamic range - a lower distance between the highs and lows of light. This allows the camera to \"see\" more of the scene, to record more detail in an image.</p>\r\n<p>Thirdly, the camera sensor captures just the basic luminance of a scene rather than the luminosity we \"see\" as a result of a complicated combination of eye and brain function. There are four terms of light to discuss here for a moment. <strong><em>Illumination</em></strong> is the light on an object from the world around it - the light from the sun lighting up the leaves of a tree, for example. <strong><em>Reflection</em></strong> is the light bouncing off an object onto the world around it. <em><strong>Luminance</strong></em> is a combination of reflection and illumination. The camera and the human retina see the same luminance. <strong><em>Luminosity</em></strong> is a product of a process in the rear of the brain. Here, the visual cortex processes the luminance registered by the retina, separates that from the reflection and recombines them in a special way to show us the world. We first are shown edges, those edges are separated into illumination edges and reflection edges. Then, our brain uses complicated algorithms to process the image into our perception of luminance, called luminosity or brightness.</p>\r\n<p>Fourthly our eyes have the ability to focus in/concentrate on the center of its field of view but a camera sees everything within its field of view with equal clarity. The human eye scans a subject to take it all in, while the camera will record it whole and fixed.</p>\r\n<p>Now, once we understand the way our camera sees, we have many controls available to us for managing our image.</p>\r\n<p>What are our tools?</p>\r\n<p>1. Composition. The most basic tool for creating our photograph is where we decide to place the camera in relation to our subject. Then there are decisions about our lens focal length, f-stop, and shutter speed. We\'ll talk about this more in future lessons. Most of the general tips on how to compose or frame a good image apply just as well to black-and-white photography as they do in color. The main obvious difference is that you don\'t have color to lead the eye into or around your shot or to create feeling or interest. This means, as we\'ve already started, you must train yourself to look at shapes, tones and textures in your frame as points of interest. Pay particularly attention to where the shadows and highlights fall in reference to your subject and know they will become important features of your image.</p>\r\n<p>2. Shape and Pattern. Related to, yet separate and beyond the composition of our image, patterns or shapes can sometimes go unseen in color. The color itself will often draw our attention and even perhaps create its own shapes and patterns that we will not see in the grayscale world. In addition, these shapes and patterns of the dimension of the grayscale that we don\'t see with our color eyes can come alive in a black-and-white image. Grayscale images based upon or accentuating patterns and shapes will often take on an abstract quality and show us the world in a way people don\'t get to see it everyday.</p>\r\n<p>Example of photographs made for shape and pattern include the following three below:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Contrast. One of the elements that first catches the eye and gives interest to a black-and-white image is contrast. In the world of the human eye, color often distinguishes one thing from another for us. In a grayscale world you can\'t use color to distinguish the elements from each other. The tonal variances become all the more important. This doesn\'t mean you need to look for stark contrasts in every image you want to photograph for black-and-white. Your subject matter and your message will come into play here. You should think about, however, how the contrast will come into play when composing your image.</p>\r\n<p>Example - High contrast image:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Example - Low contrast image:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Example - Contrast is used in this image to accentuate the subjects of the image. The subjects are in high contrast to their surroundings and the surroundings do not contain a lot of contrast:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>4. Lighting. Closely connected to contrast, lighting style in a grayscale image is very important. Direct illumination can add to contrast and can make dramatic, powerful images. Side lighting can reveal the texture of your subject and in portraits will accentuate a person\'s features and can also accentuate dramatic feelings. Diffuse light reduces contrast and can create soft, romantic or mysterious images. Stronger light or contrast will often evoke more drama from a scene and image. We\'ll explore lighting style more than this mention in later lessons.</p>\r\n<p>5. Texture. Texture was just mentioned in the discussion of side lighting. The texture of a subject can add greater dimension to an image. Sidelight shows texture by creating shadows. This can make a subject feel much more alive, or that feeling of it \"coming right of the page\" and bring a viewer to relate in a much more \"real\", intimate, or visceral way to your subject. This can be good or bad. It depends what you want to convey and what mood or thought you want to create with your image. We\'ll also explore texture in a later lesson. I just want to mention it here as part of an overview on elements of black-and-white images that are important.</p>\r\n<p><strong>One practical tip I would like to introduce here:</strong></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Photograph with the lowest ISO possible. I shoot at 100 unless I just can\'t possibly and still have the shutter speed and/or aperture I want to create the image I have in mind. While this is something that most of us do in color photography it is particularly important when it comes to black-and-white where noise created by an ISO setting can become even more obvious. If you\'re after this &lsquo;noise\' (or grain) that\'s another issue. Once you have it though, know it\'s tough to get out even with the many post-production software tools on the market today. So unless you are absolutely sure sure you want noise, do all you can to avoid it.</strong></em></p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 10:24:23','2015-03-25 13:30:37'),(158,52,'Developing B & W: Computer and Software',NULL,'<p>Ok. We\'ve touched on seeing in grayscale with both human eyes and camera and begun to explore expression through black-and-white photography. The next step is to get you started on image processing.</p>\r\n<p>The digital world being one of very rapid growth and change, I can\'t begin to cover all of the hardware or software options or features that there are or will be even by time I finish writing this lesson. I personally work with Adobe products and Mac computers, so I will mostly use these when I reference software examples. Even if your software is different, the basic techniques are the same for developing digital images.</p>\r\n<p>Often RAW converters will have tools with which to develop your images, although these aren\'t always as complete or sophisticated as the tools you\'ll find in programs like Photoshop for example. I suggest you use the RAW conversion software that came with your camera for this lesson - just to allow us to keep things simple. You can work with the basics such as look at your histogram, convert to grayscale, adjust color conversion sliders and bring out more of your image and make your expression according to your vision.</p>\r\n<p>At it\'s simplest, there are three basic image qualities for developing black-and-white photographs: brightness, contrast and tonal range. Let\'s address these in this lesson.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Brightness.</strong> The most common word used to describe the amount of light we see is brightness. It is how we perceive luminance, which in turn is the amount of light that reaches the eye or sensor from a surface or light source. In digital photography you can increase the brightness both in the exposure of the image (allow more light to the camera sensor when you are making the image) and in post-production (by raising the values of mainly the mid-tones using the \"Brightness\" slider).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Contrast.</strong> This is the ratio between high and low luminance values, but does not necessarily involve the entire tonal range. Commonly, it refers to the ratio excluding the top level of highlights and the lowest level of shadows/blacks.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tonal Range</strong> is the ratio between the maximum and minimum values in an image. If the ratio is small, the photograph will appear \"flat\" or low contrast. If the ratio is high the image will have strong or high contrast and look \"contrasty\". In high contrast images there is a danger of losing the information in either or both your high and low lights.</p>\r\n<p>Standard black-and-white image processing attempts to make the very lowest/darkest tones in the image a fraction short of pure black and the highest/lightest tones a fraction short of pure white. Now this is of course open to creative interpretation, but that\'s for our next lesson. For now let\'s stay with the standard processing.</p>\r\n<p><br />Open one of the images you\'ve taken this week in your RAW converter software and let\'s start with looking at tonal range.</p>\r\n<p>Look at the histogram of your RAW file in your software\'s histogram display. If the tonal scale of the image fits within the scale of the histogram, you have a \"fully-scaled\" image. If you see the histogram information pushed far to the right of the scale and all the way to the end of the histogram, you have areas that are over-exposed - \"clipped highlights\". If your information is pushed far to the left or bunched up against that left wall of the histogram you have large areas that are under-exposed.</p>\r\n<p>In your RAW converter there are some tools that can recover some of the information in over-exposed or under-exposed images, but this can create it\'s own set of issues. For this beginning course I suggest you start with getting your exposures correct in the camera - a good practice for the rest of your photographic life, actually.</p>\r\n<p>Now find one of your images from our last two lessons that fits within the histogram display and is a \"fully-scaled\" image. Open it in the RAW converter.</p>\r\n<p>This below is what my Photoshop RAW converter looks like with an image open in it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Convert your image to grayscale.</p>\r\n<p>A note on Grayscale Conversion: Most RAW software will have a \"convert to grayscale\" button or box. If yours doesn\'t, look for a saturation or de-saturation slider and move it all the way to the left in order to remove all the color from your image; leaving you with a monochrome or grayscale version of your image. You may find grayscale effect presets that emulate different films or film processing \"looks\" such as sepia, high contrast, low contrast, heavy grain, etc. Avoid these for this lesson and stick with the basic grayscale conversion offered by your software, as in the example below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Make sure you can see the histogram display for your image while you work on it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Move the Exposure slider to the right until you see the highlights begin to touch the edge of the histogram scale or your software\'s histogram highlight clipping alert shows itself (different software will show this in different ways - read the instructions for your software). Now back off just a tiny bit from the highest spot on the histogram, moving the exposure slider slightly back to the left, as I\'ve demonstrated below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Move the Blacks slider to the right until you see the histogram information move all the way to the left end of the box or your black clipping alert shows. Then back it off to the right slightly (next example below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>So we\'ve addressed the highs and lows of our image. Now let\'s look at our mid-tones. The basic term for working with mid-tones is brightness. You\'ll see a brightness slider in your RAW conversion software tools. Brightness is defined as perceived luminance. Refer back to the terms we discussed back in our previous two lessons. In your RAW conversion work, a Brightness slider will raise values within the black and white points without creating or addressing clipping.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Experiment with your brightness slider. Move it back and forth left and right and watch what it affects both in your image and in the image\'s histogram.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Use the brightness slider to lighten or darken the mid-tones of your image without significantly affecting the black and white points. The mid-tones of an image are what the human eye is most sensitive to (next example below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now in this process remember that the most important thing is how the image looks to you. The only thing I like to use my histogram for is really to know if I\'ve lost highlights or blacks to clipping.</p>\r\n<p>Contrast adjustment. If you look at an image as a whole, its contrast is the ratio between the darkest tones and the brightest. It may not include the very brightest or very darkest, however, because you may have small outliers that are apart from the main image range - like a small glint on a piece of metal or a bright spot in the sky near the sun and so forth (these are called specular highlights and aren\'t included in considering the overall contrast of an image).</p>\r\n<p>The traditional way of adjusting contrast is with a curve in software such as Photoshop. If you have Photoshop, or another program with a Curves tool, experiment with it. Take one point in the upper part and drag it brighter, then a second point in the lower part and drag it in the opposite direction. This gives you a classic S-curve and increases the overall contrast of your image. The reverse - lowering the value of the brighter parts and raising that of the shadows - gives you a lower contrast (see below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If you don\'t have software with a Curves tool then use the Contrast slider in your RAW software tool area and adjust it up and down or left/right to see the changes in your image (example below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These two following images of a young male water buffalo calf named Amor are another example of the difference you can make in an image using global/overall contrast controls.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Color Grayscale Balance: Using the color sliders in your RAW conversion software you can change the values of the gray tones based on the colors of the original image. For instance, this is where you can lighten or darken the sky or a cliff of red sandstone or a field of straw. These sliders can be used to replicate the impact of colored filters that used to be a part of the on-camera aspect of black-and-white photography. With these sliders we no longer must carry filters with us or commit ourselves to these filters and their affects upon image capture. I like this a lot. Experiment with the sliders. I\'ll often slide one all the way to the left or right to see how far I have the option to go, then I back off to where I envision it creatively. I often am surprised at how much magenta or purple exist in an image that my eyes don\'t detect so experiment with these sliders as well, even if you don\'t see those colors at first, as demonstrated in the example below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These three images of a sadhu in Rishikesh, India sharing his breakfast with a stray cow are an example of using the color sliders to make adjustments that can make a big difference in the look of a grayscale image.</p>\r\n<p>Here below is the original color image before RAW conversion and processing.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This image below is after basic RAW conversion to grayscale.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next image has had some global contrast adjustment and color slider adjustments. Notice how the color sliders have changed the appearance of the sadhu\'s clothing and how this affects the impact of the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>All of these adjustments that we\'ve discussed should be made so that the image looks good to your eye, meaning that it looks the way you imagine the scene, creating the visual story you want to tell. Remember black-and-white photography is not a replication of the world we see with our eye, it is a representation of it.</p>\r\n<p>One of the greatest things I have learned is to KEEP IT SIMPLE in regards to tools and the amount of developing I do. Photoshop and digital photography processing programs like it offer endless options that are in effect a jungle you can very easily be lost in or wander aimlessly in and come out with an image that looks nothing like what you wanted it to in the beginning. It can be a bit like the a frog in boiling water that doesn\'t realize it is cooking as the temperature rises in gradual increments.</p>\r\n<p>For further study on digital processing I recommend two books: <em>Black And White Printing, Creating the Digital Master Print</em>, by George DeWolfe and Ansel Adams\' book, <em>The Negative</em>.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 10:26:00','2015-03-25 13:33:49'),(159,52,'Expressing Yourself in Monochrome',NULL,'<p>Lesson one of this course explored the visualization of a photograph before making an exposure. In the other two lessons we explored some basic techniques for creating the black-and-white image and the world of the gray scale. Now, to wrap up our introductory course we\'ll explore further into the creative choices of expression in black-and-white.</p>\r\n<p>As a black-and-white photographer you express feelings with tones of the gray scale. Edward Weston said: \"The ultimate end, the print, is but a duplication of all that I saw and felt through my camera.\" What blend of tones expresses joy or happiness? What contrast will express anger? What combination of tones expresses how your subject felt and how you felt about your subject in the moment you made the photographic exposure?</p>\r\n<p>First, let\'s revisit perhaps the greatest difference between color and black-and-white photography - the nature of the expression. The most accepted standard for color photography is realism - to be faithful to the original scene and render it as close as possible to how we would have perceived it if we had been there during the exposure. Black-and-white photography doesn\'t, and can\'t, begin to approach realism - its lack of color automatically abstracts a scene, creates a new reality in shades of gray. This point may seem obvious and, even though we\'ve discussed it in previous lessons, it\'s important to mention again.</p>\r\n<p>In black-and-white photography, because of its automatic abstractness, all your choices for visualizing a scene, exposing it, processing it and printing it are creative. This opens the gates for the imagination and you have the choice to interpret a scene and your image of it in almost any way you wish.</p>\r\n<p>So where does one begin, with so many creative options wide open to you? Well the starting point for Ansel Adams, like Edward Weston, was that a black-and-white image should show what you saw and felt. While Ansel\'s photography was considered \'realistic\', the actual value relationships in much of his work were far from a literal transcript of \'reality\'. He worked his black-and-white negatives and prints to represent the equivalent of what he saw and felt about his subject. He measured his success by whether or not the viewer accepted the image as its own fact and responded emotionally and aesthetically to it. In the notes on his images he repeats again and again how a particular landscape felt, the mood of the occasion, how it affected him at the time he photographed it: \"The mood of the scene was dramatic and called for a deep-valued image - a literal rendition of values would not do at all!\"</p>\r\n<p>In black-and-white photography, light and shadow are your raw ingredients. The light determines the contrast and overall mood of the image. The way it creates harsh shadows and highlights or is dispersed softly throughout the image, and the direction from which it is lighting your subject.</p>\r\n<p>Edward Weston and Ansel Adams shared many of the same ideas about rich tonality and a \'honesty\' to both form and content and a desire to capture the full range of light. They both leaned toward dramatic expressions with rich blacks balanced against just-discernible high-value textures in elements like snow, clouds and water spray.</p>\r\n<p>Now let\'s address five things you can use in your expression in black-and-white: high contrast, low contrast, high key, low key and texture.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choosing Contrast for Expression:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Contrast can be emphasized or minimized in black-and-white in ways beyond what are possible in color. Contrast is the distance between the highest tones and the lowest tones of an image (as we defined and discussed in the last lesson). A high-contrast image has fewer gray tones and more intense blacks and whites. Good contrast can make an image snap and feel alive. Poor contrast can make an image feel flat and lifeless. Very high contrast can make an image feel raw or harsh. Very low contrast can create the feeling of romance or gentleness. As a general rule of thumb, an image with good contrast should have deep blacks, clean whites, and a good range of gray tones.</p>\r\n<p>Look at this image of the piglet. Decide for yourself which one feels innocent and playful. Which one feels raw? Which feels the most active? Which one would you choose for an image of a new playful piglet? Which if any one to express noisy and smelly barnyard?</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>High Contrast:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Very high-contrast images contain mostly high and low tones, with few mid-tones (an extreme range between bright and dark) and can be used to focus attention to one element in the image. It is a great way of emphasizing structure and form - key qualities in black-and-white photography. The traditional S-curve that raises the lower highlights and lowers the dark mid-tones is the standard tool for raising global contrast. High contrast can really make the image, the subject leap off the paper at you, feel aggressive, look harsh or very dramatic.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Low Contrast:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Low contrast images contain mostly mid-tones, with few highs and lows (a narrow brightness range) and can be used to convey serenity and peace. Low contrast can be often found in situations of a cloudy day, fog, mist, rain. It creates a softening effect from atmosphere and has a certain evocative appeal. Low-contrast images depend on the gradation of gray tones rather than dramatic shifts in tones.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Remember, maintaining low contrast when processing your image is accomplished essentially by not making any adjustments to the black and white points. The histogram accompanying the as-shot low contrast image should have plenty of open room on the right (highlight) and left (black) sides. This gives plenty of room for keying - shifting to the lower key or higher key while retaining the same contrast and clipping either your highs or your lows. We\'ll talk about keys in just a bit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Normal Contrast:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Normal contrast images contain a full range of tones from black, through the mid-tone grays and into the highlights. The higher the range of tones in an image, the greater the sense of depth and separation among objects in the image. Normal contrast is a wise option when you want a \"realistic\" presentation of an image. Some things in the photos are light or white, some are dark or black and some are gray.</p>\r\n<p>Here is a normal contrast image as you can see by it\'s appearance and histogram. Notice the broad range of tones and the massing of tones in the mid-tone area when you look at the histogram and the image itself. What feeling does this image give you? Consider the reasons why it makes you feel what it does.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Lighting is critical in black-and-white photography and is what creates your image\'s contrast. Strong, direct lighting, for example, can bring a flat surface to life, revealing intricate textures and displaying surface features on individual planes that provide separation. Likewise, the same light can introduce unwanted shadows. In shooting black and white, use light to define, separate, and interrelate the elements in the photograph. Remember, light is all you have to work with to define the elements of your image.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Choosing Tonal Key For Expression:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The next tools of expression in black-and-white photography are the tonal keys. Skewing the tones in an image towards the extremes - either the dark or the light ends of the tonal spectrum - can dramatically change the mood of an image. This is described as low- and high-key imagery. \"Key\" refers to the overall tonal quality of the finished image in this context. By changing key, you impact the mood and emotion of the image on the viewer. A high-key image will generally be read as ethereal and/or innocent and a low-key image as anything from gloomy and weighty, to foreboding or deeply mysterious.</p>\r\n<p>One thing to remember is that contrast and key are not the same thing. A photograph may be low in contrast, yet high in key, such as the white dune against a bright sky in the image above.</p>\r\n<p>Another note on keys is that high-key and low-key images should not be confused with dark, underexposed or light, overexposed images. Both high- and low-key images are fully toned with a range of grays, from solid black through to paper white. However, a high-key image will have predominantly light tones while a low-key image will show predominantly dark tones.</p>\r\n<p><strong>High-Key:</strong></p>\r\n<p>For high-key to work visually it is important to introduce a dark shadow, however small, to establish that this is a true full-toned image and not a poor exposure There usually needs to be some smaller darker elements that are integral to the image. Raising the brightness and contrast throws emphasis on whatever smaller darker areas remain.</p>\r\n<p>High-Key images often feel graphic - imagery in which lines and points, the rawest graphic forms dominate, while tonal gradation is suppressed. This in turn creates abstractions. High-key often appeals to those for who content is less important than form.</p>\r\n<p>One important area of decision in a high-key image is whether or not to allow the edges of the image, extremely pale in a high-key, to bleed into the surrounding paper. The most traditional approach has been to hold the brightest tone a noticeable level darker than pure paper white, in order to hold the limits of the image, but the balance is a fine one, because too far below white runs the risk of looking muddy. This issue extends to mounting and framing as the eye of the viewer is inevitably affected by the difference in tone. One option is to frame the image in black.</p>\r\n<p>This image is a high key and somewhat high contrast image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>This image is a high key, low contrast image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Low-Key:</strong></p>\r\n<p>While a darker/lower key can be applied to any image according to the mood of the photographer, certain kinds of lighting and scene lend themselves more readily to it than others. Ideal conditions for low-key are when a large object or area within the frame of your photograph, even most of it, is deeply shadowed. In low-key images most of your shadow areas have no detail. In a low-key image you need at least on point of bright light to establish the full impact of the final image.</p>\r\n<p>This is a low-key image. It is also a high contrast image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>This image is low key and is also a high contrast image, even though most of it\'s tones fall close together in the lower mid-range if you look at it\'s histogram.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>Using a reflected light meter to set the exposure for either high- or low-key images will result in underexposure or overexposure because the meter will recommend an exposure that will produce an average mid-grey tone. It is important when making keyed images to use an incident light meter to measure the light falling on the subject rather than the reflected light coming from the scene. Set your camera to spot meter rather than the broad metering many cameras have as a default setting. Your camera instruction manual will have information on its meter if you have questions about setting it properly for this work.</p>\r\n<p>To express yourself in black-and-white well, you have to really pay attention to the quality of light you are working with, even if you are not planning to control or change it. In the studio, photographers have the opportunity to modify and shape the light. In the real world it is important to recognize and make the best of the quality of light in any given situation. Black-and-white imagery draws attention to the shadows and flowing lines that show form. Use lighting to make your subject look three-dimensional. Side lighting shows form and texture by casting shadows. Front and backlighting obscure it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Texture:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Black-and-white photography is a great chance to create compositions that show off intriguing textures and patterns and the texture in a photograph can really bring a subject alive in a black-and-white image. Texture is really just a form of contrast, but it is perceived very differently - the regular or irregular pattern of shadows and highlights at various intensities. Texture is also structure and form on a small scale, meaning small relative to view. Because a texture is something that is reasonably consistent over a substantial area of a surface, it is usually a repetitive structure.</p>\r\n<p>Be sure to use light - natural or light you create - to add shadows that make the pattern stand out. Try waiting for low-angled light or shooting into the light to reveal textures. Also try shooting in diffused light to reveal texture with more subtle shadows. In these images it is crucial that the texture is very sharp. Use a tripod and a small aperture for images highlighting texture.</p>\r\n<p>Texture is affected by the lighting conditions. Low, raking light, typical of the golden hour of light near sunrise and sunset, makes texture stand out very sharply. The soft light of an overcast day can also bring out texture, though you might need to help it some in post processing with by increasing the global or local contrast.</p>\r\n<p>This image shows a lot of texture of a large subject, a broad area. It was taken near sunset, when the light is coming at a low angle and is helped by the strong contrast of the fresh bright snow on the darker pines and against the dark storm cloud.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This image shows the texture of the sand both broadly with the wind ripples and minutely with the grain. It was taken late in the day when the sun was coming in at a low enough angle that the small ripple edges could cast shadows and the grains themselves could even cast shadows.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>Now to apply these techniques, use the tools you have learned in your previous lessons in this course.</p>\r\n<p>The most important thing to remember in any of this is to explore, be creative and make your aim the expression of the way you see and feel the world. As Ansel Adams said: \"A fine print has been generally assumed to have a full range of values, clear delineation of form and texture, and a satisfactory print \"color.\' But what a catastrophe it would be if all photographs only met these criteria!\"</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 13:23:53','2015-03-25 13:36:45'),(160,53,'Equipping Yourself – Rights and Mobility',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Selecting gear.

Simply put - street photography includes any photograph made anywhere in public places. From beaches and parks to political conventions, these venues are the subject matter for creating telling and dramatic images that communicate across cultures and down through time. They are what speaks of the Human Condition we are all a part of.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Some photographers narrow this genre down to urban settings, focusing their lenses not on people, but on the graphic elements and designs in metal and concrete, they create. This approach I took in the first photo example below. In this situation it was definitely the light that attracted my eye. How it played unevenly - with with rich quality - across this clay-red, high-rise building. This would have been enough in its own right, but the added network of nature in this sprawling tree in front of it, gave natural expression to this otherwise human-made scene. It is scenes in the city that build on the street photographer\'s desire to communicate a message with the photographs that he or she creates.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>At the other end of the street-photographer spectrum lies those who feel that people must always be included when a composition is made. The following photograph represents one of my own captures of such a situation. The scene is that of a lake near city-center in Hamburg, Germany, around which people exercise both day and night. I would pass this location nearly every day while walking around the city, looking for compelling photographs. A lot of people exercise here, both day and night. During daylight hours this scene could be quite boring, particularly photographed under overcast skies and in the flat light it produces. Instead, I chose to make my photographs of this particular view of the city with the its warm, colorful lights shining across the water and capturing one of its early evening joggers blurring across the foreground, right in front of it all. The shot would have been effective enough without human presence, but the moving silhouette of a runner against it all adds that something special - that \"moment\" to the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Take any ten photographers and the purpose of their efforts will vary widely. Some photographers are interested in simply and honestly documenting life as it unfolds before their camera, yet placing their own interpretation to the scene. An example (next photo) of this, which I also made on a downtown street in Hamburg, brought an intended subtle humor to an otherwise \"typical\" street scene. What I like best about this particular photo is the \"timing\" of having captured all three women taking a bite of their pizza at the same instant. The in-focus statue just behind them, add a \"laid-back\" counterpoint to their extremely \"into it\" efforts - a \"different dimension\" to the composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Another such photograph I made while awaiting a subway train. Not far from me stood a woman and her small dog. This situation drew my interest and I began to think of just how I might compose a photograph of this person as she waited. I finally came to the image shown in the next photograph below. Shifting camera position, I was able to substitute the dog\'s head for her own, resulting in a somewhat humorous - and somewhat psychological - interpretation of a subway passenger waiting in the crowd.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>As you see, there are those who want to make artistic photographs of available street scenes and those who just basically enjoy taking pictures and do it purely for the pleasure of it all. Within \"Street Photography,\" there\'s room - for it all. And given this diverse situation, it is no real surprise that hard-and-fast set of rules and guidelines connected with the genre simply DO NOT APPLY.</p>\r\n<p>In 2007 I did a lot of street photography in Hamburg, where I\'d arrived on a one-year scholarship from Geo magazine. This was a tough time for me. For one thing, I was totally unfamiliar with the city - its streets and places of interest. I was from a different part of the world - the South Asian country of Bangladesh - and my shorter stature and skin color called immediate attention to me wherever I went with my camera. I was always visible to my subject, not able to hide and for these reasons, I was a bit hesitant. I was never sure just how people in Germany would react to me approaching them to make pictures.</p>\r\n<p>It was because of all of this that I decided I would dedicate this year-long opportunity to doing street photography. I would go everywhere with my camera and I would photograph all that I found there. And with this material, I decided that at the end of this year - back home in Bangladesh - I would have an exhibition and publish a book of this work. But before leaving Germany, I would first exhibit what I\'d captured to people here, presenting their Hamburg as seen through a Bangladeshi photographer\'s eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Street Photography in Europe - and in Germany, in particular - was greatly different than doing it in my homeland. In Bangladesh you can take peoples\' pictures very easily. No one really asks you where you\'re from or what you will do with the picture.</p>\r\n<p>\"Are you from the newspaper?\"</p>\r\n<p>But in Hamburg it was different. Almost everyone asked me why I am taking this photo. So I told them that I came from Bangladesh and I was staying in Germany for one year. I am taking pictures of daily life here, I would tell them, sometimes through a friend who would translate for me. So when I go back, I\'ll arrange that exhibition and show a completely different world to people who have really no idea what it\'s like here. And as simple as this answer was, it helped me a lot to achieve my goals. People even began giving me their \"permission\" to take their picture - even while kissing on the street. It was amazing!</p>\r\n<p>This brings us to an important point - just when is written permission to photograph someone or something required? In most countries like my own, it simply doesn\'t (legally) matter under any circumstances. In the western world, however, things like this vary greatly, but in general one does not need to obtain a signature to photograph in any public place as long as the photograph, if it is to be published, is done so in an editorial fashion (i.e. newspaper, magazine, internet site, etc.). If there is a commercial purpose behind making and using the photograph (i.e. advertising), that a so-called, \"model release\" is required. And, such forms can easily be found and downloaded from the internet these days. All this said, it\'s still good to ask permission when you are photographing in close-quarters to a person. They then feel a part of things and your work tends to go just that much better.</p>\r\n<p>Still another thing that a street photographer must be attentive to, but cannot control of course, is the weather. You just have to make the best of the conditions you have. In Hamburg most of the time the weather is gray and rainy. For me, it was sometimes there difficult for color photography. Overcast skies spell dull, flat light, but I decided to do my work in color.anyway. Otherwise, my photographs would not be realistic. Black and white brings another dimension in itself. The human eye, of course, doesn\'t view the world this way, so my personal decision is not to use it. Besides, for me as a professional photographer, monochrome photographs are simply difficult to market.</p>\r\n<p>While doing street photography in a major German city like Hamburg, I discovered so many homeless people. The subject drew my interest and I made plans to do a long-term photo-story on these people living on the street. One of the images (below) from this was of a woman living on the street near city-center. I made this photograph in front of a Nike shop where she was sitting. And although the street was busy with cars and pedestrians, no one paid her any notice or offered her any help. Her dog looked as depressed as she did and this was a visual element of the composition of importance to me.&nbsp; Another reason I like this shot so much, is that there\'s so much happening in it. There was a bank-teller machine on the left and an interesting advertisement behind her. And - I had luck here too, because as I was squeezing the shutter button, a bicycle peddled by, adding still another \"layer\" - another dimension of visual complexity to this wide-angle shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>I spent quite a lot of time talking with this woman while photographing her. So much so, in fact, that I soon became invisible to her and was able to work in a relaxed and candid fashion.</p>\r\n<p>There came other ideas for larger stories, too. Things like Muslim living in Hamburg, a particular street artist and his companion dog, old people in the city and the whole culture surrounding tattoos. I came with so many ideas to take photos, that time itself for completing everything became a major concern. The people, the new situations, scenes - all the interesting places one visits to make street pictures had opened up a whole new life for me in a sense.Equipment is, of course, a part of this exploration. Most of the time, I used only one lens - a 28mm, semi-wide angle on the camera I carried. This is one of two lens choices I\'ve made for my street photography work. The second lens is a 35mm prime that brings me just a little closer to my subjects. Either focal length - or both - is excellent for this type of candid, reportage work on the go. Without the need to change lenses or worry about just what focal length to use (as one does with a zoom), one can fully concentrate on the subject.</p>\r\n<p>Doing street photography doesn\'t have to mean that you must always be moving - always on the go. Sometimes you can just find a good place and wait for the \"action\" to come to you. I did and still do this a lot when I find an interesting background. Billboards are a favorite of mine for this. Like that I came across in the next picture. I found this one of the couple kissing particularly of interest and I waited for an hour or so for just the right people to pass in front of it - to create some kind of \"psychological\" connection - a combination of \"real\" and \"not real\" that would bring the viewer to thinking about the picture. What struck me was that here in the billboard advertisement we have two people being intimate and just in front of them - in \"real time\" - there are these human beings passing and they don\'t even as much as look at each other. This was the message - the sense of \"irony\" I wanted to get across to the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Using another \"prop,\" I made the photograph that follows.&nbsp; I was on my way to the Frankfurt Book Fair and standing in a queue at the Hamburg airport when I saw this life-like billboard advertisement behind a mother and son standing to the left of it. The look on their faces was one of \"concern\" and I immediately made the connection with the snarling cat. I squeezed the shutter button. These are just two examples from the many billboard and interesting background combination photos I have made in Europe and elsewhere. The combination of fantasy and reality that these kinds of photographs include can be quite powerful in bringing a street photographer\'s message across to the viewer. And by the way, when you see it, take it!. I returned to this same location a week later to find this billboard removed. So - if it catches your eye, make that photograph right then and there. You may not get a second chance.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Things happen quickly on the street and to capture \"the moment,\" you need to be always at ready. Such as with the next picture. This photograph was made at a circus venue. I came across this great, huge painting of a zebra on the wall and thought it would make a good photo with just the \"right\" person standing or passing in front of it. I stood and waited for quite a while for this \"special element\" to show up, but it never did. Then just when I was about to move on, this door opened and a man walked through pushing his bicycle. My camera was set for optimum reaction speed and I made the shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Concentrated I always am when at work, but sometimes that still isn\'t enough to capture the most expressive and meaningful moments that unfold before your eyes in an instant. For this reason, I set my camera and lens on \"auto focus.\" If your own camera has this capability - and most cameras these days do, I suggest you do the same. For measuring light, I use \"spot-metering\" to get the best exposure, basing it on the most important element of the composition. To be able to cover a range of lighting situation and still retain good detail in my street pictures, I set ISO at 200 on my camera.</p>\r\n<p>\"Street life\" represents the world in small-scale. It is a slice of what humans do on a daily basis. A photographer working here must be ever alert, for life passes quickly and you must be ready to seize the \"moment.\" This \"blink of the eye\" in time is the very essence of street photography. For me the most important thing is the subject and the story about the photos. You can improve easily your sense about technique, but most important is to improve your eyes - the way you see what happens around you.&nbsp; For the street photographer, the most important thing is carry a camera all the time. <strong><em>Never go out without your camera</em><em>!</em></strong></p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 17:24:32','2015-03-25 17:46:55'),(161,53,'Finding Your Way',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Promising themes. Thinking ahead. Making a choice.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>When I was photographing street life in Germany, I began by shooting everything I liked. However, I was also looking for one or more subjects that really interested me and that I felt I could work on for a longer time - extended projects, \"works-in-progress\" kind of thing. The homeless; dogs as pets; Muslims in Europe; old people - all of these were high on my list. The visual stimulation of the street can become fast-paced and intense at times, making it easy to forget themes that just briefly flash before your eyes. For this reason, I faithfully carry a small notebook and pen with me to jot things down that could be followed up on later. Each evening following such a day of street shooting, I take a few moments to review my notes and make plans as to specifically what (when and where) my future shooting schedule will be.</p>\r\n<p>It was exactly this process that brought me to focusing more attention on the homeless people of this - what was to my eye - very rich European city of Hamburg, Germany. Why should there be people living on the street here? This seemed to me only something to be found in the less fortunate parts of the world. I wanted to learn more and I wanted to make my findings visual - for all to see.</p>\r\n<p>My initial work on this project was only roughly planned. By this I mean that I just started to make pictures!&nbsp; The first one of these (below) is an indication of my direction. This photo was made just outside Hamburg\'s main rail station - a place of congregation for many of the homeless here. This young man had just migrated to Germany from an eastern European country and was sleeping on the street - literally. The shot was made using a 28mm wide-angle lens in order to show a \"sense of place\" - a context for the subject of the photo. I paid particular attention to light and color when making this image. The scheme of red and blue brings an element of \"aesthetic\" to the whole of the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Part of this beginning phase included, of course, getting to know some of these people - my \"subjects\" - on a more personal and friendly basis. Although not fluent in their language, I used smiles, gestures and my camera monitor to build working relationships. By showing what photographs I had taken, I made the subject an active part of my project. I brought these people prints too and quite soon many began to trust me. It was never my intent to simply photograph individuals I\'d met on the street and never see them again. I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of their way of life - how they got to this stage of survival and how they maintained it on a daily basis. The depiction in the next photo is aimed at bringing across just such a quest. Here was a place where six people lived together in an abandoned space on the backside of a building. This person I caught napping in the afternoon. For me, it was the color of this house and the body language of this homeless person that combined to give this composition its interest.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Yet another contextual (\"environmental\") shot is that seen in the photo example below. However, instead of creating just a \"what was there\" photograph, I wanted to give a feel for the social element that surrounds street people, in general. I used once more a 28mm lens to show this homeless girl from Bulgaria, begging on a central shopping street in Hamburg. People were passing her by and paying no attention to her. I sat there on the street directly opposite for some time, just watching. Who were these people walking by? Why did they not see her?</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>As a street photographer, you should always be looking for the most telling perspectives from which to shoot. Sometimes when you get down low, like I did to make this photo, you come away with a whole new perspective on your subject. I always try to see the situation from as many angles as possible - top, bottom, sides. Important too in this particular photo above, are the converging lines of the sidewalk, which are accentuated by the wide-angle lens (28mm) I used. The street photographer needs to pay attention to each and every element that goes into the photograph. The lines cutting the sidewalk here add a different energy to the picture, as well as guide the viewer\'s eye to the subject of this composition - the street woman.</p>\r\n<p>I photograph close to my subject the majority of the time, but I also try to include some content - a \"telling\" portion of the surrounding environment in the shot. Such is the case of this street person playing his accordion under a train bridge, his daughter keeping him company in the following photograph. I\'ll then take a step or two closer and shoot a \"tighter\" frame from another angle to capture further elements of the same scene, as demonstrated in the next shot. Here I used a shallow depth of field (i.e. wide aperture setting) and came close enough to leave out the head of the foreground musician, creating a more interesting composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Although a wide-angle lens is the \"mainstay\" of a street photographers equipment, it isn\'t always my lens of choice. When I want to get somewhere fast and capture the moment quickly, a telephoto serves well, too. Such was the case with the photograph below, where I was some distance away when I spotted this woman on the street interacting with her dog. The 70-200mm zoom (with a wide-aperture set), allowed me to photograph this kiss in \"intimate\" space, while softening a confusing background. The combination served to place greater emphasis on the subject (woman and dog) itself. But it wasn\'t just the interaction of pet and owner that caught my eye in this scene, it was the color of the dog\'s coat, the woman\'s hair and the jacket she wore that brought this composition together and made it work in my eyes.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>After a number of days of shooting and interacting with these people, I sat down at the computer to do a first edit of what I had produced. With no photographer friends close by to help me with this task of seeing critically and objectively, I came up with my own means of doing so. I made some small snapshot-sized prints of what I considered to be the best images from this initial collection. I then hung these with tape around my bathroom mirror, where I would see them many times per day. Sometimes I directed my attention to each. Other times, when I was in a hurry, they would be seen more on a subconscious level. These photos remained this way for about a week. Eventually, some of these pictures began to lose their impact and when they did, I took them down. These were not the strong images I was after. At the end of the week there were just a few photographs remaining on my bathroom wall - the ones that stood my \"test of time.\" These then - I felt - represented the best photographs I had from my subject, to-date. Those with the most visual impact. I still practice this exercise in self-editing and feel it\'s a great way to improve one\'s own work with a critical eye.</p>\r\n<p>One thing that separates a \"thinking\" street shooter from one that simply walks around all day snapping this and snapping that, is emphasis placed on collecting \"information\" about the theme or subject. Honing your vision in regards to certain subject-matter can also productively include looking at the material of other photographers who\'ve worked on similar projects - comparing what they\'ve done with what you are planning to do. Of course you don\'t want to copy anything, just come to see all sides of the situation and how it has been handled by others before you.</p>\r\n<p>I did this many evenings via the internet while living in Hamburg. Most times it started with a simple Google search and went from there to the websites of photographers I\'d newly discovered. I learned much and doing this gave me fresh perspectives on my subject, suggesting new directions to go in with my street people / homeless people emphasis.</p>\r\n<p>Another step toward making the most of photographing on the street with a special subject or theme in mind, is to visit promising locations on different days of the week, as well as various times of the day. I discovered a place where homeless people received food - \"soup kitchens\" - and went there to photograph. In Hamburg. I spent a lot of time at weekend markets which drew street people looking for contributions from the public. The harbor area of this port city was another good place for me to capture my subject. There were most days a lot of tourists visiting this location, which also was an opportune place for street people to beg for money. I talked with them, joked around with them and this interaction opened up further opportunities for me to photograph.</p>\r\n<p>I placed more out-of-the-way locations on my shooting list too. The photograph that follows, for instance, was made under a bridge where homeless people sleep. This first photo below was made to show how some of these people live and the kinds of belongings they possess. And in the second photograph, I used a 28mm lens while getting close to capture a \"defining moment\" of two homeless men interacting to share a bottle of wine. Such photos of relationships and interactions adds \"flesh\" to one\'s body of street work.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>It\'s not always necessary to show people themselves, however. Use of shadows (first example below) can also lead to very interesting and informative compositions. When I first saw this man lying on the sidewalk, I wondered just how I might make this photograph in a different way. Instead of simply photographing the subject \"straight-on,\" I decided to use the strong shadows cast be passersby to emphasize this homeless person\'s \"non-personal\" status among others in this society. Key to getting creative shots as a street photographer, is to always push yourself to find new and different ways of communicating visually. The second photo example below is another indication of what I mean. Here I played on the motif of this street person\'s star-shaped tattoo, likening it to the way his fingers fan out, as he holds his cigarette.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>Still another part of my preparation for focusing on a particular street theme was to get in contact with agencies and organizations that worked regularly with street people. I explained what I was doing and why to those I approached and found most quite helpful. They provided me with information through which I came to better understand the reasons why these people were living in such a way. In some cases the reasons were similar to those behind the street-people situation back in my home country of Bangladesh, other times they were far more complex. Through this interaction, too, I was often introduced to street people I had not come across during my own wanderings about the city of Hamburg. And - I discovered a magazine set up to be sold by such people, so that they could earn small amounts of money through its sale to the public. My involvement eventually brought my own work onto its pages and through this, I was able to reach a broader audience with my project - giving \"voice\" to these peoples\' cause.</p>\r\n<p>The next step in my effort to create a \"purposeful\" body of work from all of this was to sit down and make yet another edit of everything I had photographed in this regard. I went through my digital files and made additional small prints, laid them out on my living room floor and arranged and rearranged what I had, to create a Photo Essay of 5 to 7 photos that told my story - their story - as my camera came to see it.</p>',18,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 17:25:52','2015-05-21 12:17:37'),(162,53,'Thinking - Seeing “Selects”',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Perusing your collection. First cut is the hardest. Honing fine points.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Working in a non-western country, such as my home nation of Bangladesh in South Asia, offers the street photographer a entirely different experience. To begin with, the air in these lands is not generally as clean and clear as that found in Europe or America, for example. The air in Bangladesh\'s capital city of Dhaka is quite polluted. Combine this with humidity and lots of dust and the street photos you get have a whole different color and sharpness quality than those made on the streets of Hamburg, for instance. But this isn\'t necessarily a disadvantage. Oftentimes such atmosphere, which may be not so good for breathing, can give color street pictures a quality of richness and warmth that light found elsewhere, cannot. Of course the real downside of this is that cameras - especially those with digital sensors - must be cleaned more regularly than if they were only used on the streets of European cities. When I go back to Dhaka, it\'s only a matter of a few weeks until my lenses start to accumulate dust on the underside of front elements and this is in spite of the fact that they are said by the maker to be \"sealed\" to protect against these things.</p>\r\n<p>Photographing on the streets of a city like Dhaka - one of the most densely populated urban centers in the world - really brings the senses to life - all of them! The smells, the noises, the colors, faces - on and on. Sometimes it\'s almost \"overload\" to decide just what to focus your lens on. People everywhere, there\'s not the constant search for photo possibilities. People are friendly and the number of subjects available to pursue with a camera are nearly without end. People of all social levels coming and going to work, colorful daily markets, sidewalk shops, beggars, people hawking things, traffic jams bringing heated arguments over who was in the wrong - it\'s all here - life unfolding before you. Oftentimes it\'s so much, it\'s not always easy to decide just which subject matter to work with first or to concentrate on further. It\'s great actually!</p>\r\n<p>After a day or so working the streets in this way, I\'m virtually swamped with material and it takes a while to go through it all. Naturally, as with any photographer, there are images that one at the very first glance knows are not good enough. These I delete right away and this process represents my \"first cut\" of material from that I have. After looking through what remains a few times, I then begin to develop a \"feel\" and intuition about what I\'ve made out there. It\'s through this process of \"getting to know\" my body of work that I begin to see directions in which I most want to go with my street photography in the short-term and projects I\'d like to follow on a long-time basis, too. Concentrating on the first, I start to make notes - both mental and written - as to how I want to \"mold\" the themes that most immediately gain my interest - those I want to pursue right away.</p>\r\n<p>\"Polishing\" a body of street work has as much to do with individual images as it does with the form of a collection or photo-essay, in general. Working with the best light possible, good, strong colors, strong compositions and a sense of moment - all of these add to street photographs that command viewer attention. But beyond these important characteristics of an effective photograph, what else adds interest such that the picture must be seen not just once, but looked at over and over again? Following are a number of examples to help point the way to achieve just this.</p>\r\n<p>An unfortunate scene, but one that is all too prevalent in areas of any large city, is that of kids sniffing glue. Having a wide division between rich and poor, Dhaka has this problem to a large degree, too. The photograph below depicts such a situation. Taken inside a tent-like structure in the middle of the day, natural light is reaching the subject from an open flap to the side. You can work with inside light at any time of the day, because it is not direct (usually coming through a window or open door, for instance) and generally falls evenly across the scene or subject. Outside light at midday gives you harsh, white light to work with. This \"contrasty\" situation creates strong shadows in the eyes of people and leaves bright colors \"washed-out\" in appearance. So, don\'t put your camera away from 10 a.m to 4 p.m. each day, look for areas of \"open shade\" or by window light indoors, to work in for pleasant colors and even distribution of soft, natural light to illuminate your scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>A couple other aspects of the situation surrounding this first picture example above interested me, too. The first is the color of the tent material itself. Light through and around this seemed to fit very well with the subject, setting the mood of the activity he was involved with. As far as the composition of this photograph is concerned, it too played a major role for me in the creation of this image. The triangular shape of the tree behind the boy serves to direct - to \"funnel\" the eye in the subject\'s direction and it does this in a \"heavy\" way, much like the impact of the glue on this and every user\'s being. When you create street pictures, try to incorporate background elements into their composition to bring not only visual interest, but to encourage thought on a deeper, more psychological level, too.</p>\r\n<p>The following photograph is another lesson in the use of color. Color and light are very important to me as a photographer, particularly when it comes to my work on the streets. Unlike for the most part in Europe, South Asia is alive with color. Sometimes there\'s almost too much color for a photographer to control effectively. For me, color photography is much more challenging - far more difficult, than black and white photography. You must train yourself to see various hues of a color and to understand how these work to express precisely your own photographic vision and the message you want to convey. Light you must come to know well too, for it\'s this that determines proper color. Above all else, avoid whites as much as possible in your pictures, when working in color. Leave this \"non-expressive\" color quality for monochrome work, alone.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Honing the fine points of your images includes paying more attention to the expressions of your subjects. The eyes are a good place to start with this. A person\'s eyes can be very expressive and you\'ll want to bring this out in the portraits you capture. Focus sharply on them and the rest of the face will appear in sharp focus, as well. I spend a lot of time with my subjects, talking with them - just being around them. In short time they start to become used to me being there and begin to relax in front of my camera. This is what happened while making photos of these boys in Bangladesh, below. The viewer can see in the eyes of this (these) subjects that some type of relationship has already begun to be built between me with my camera and the people I\'m focusing it on. One can feel that the photographer was there in their space for more than just a short amount of time. Take note, though, that working indoors or in any type of low-light situation requires a lens with an aperture of f-1.8 or \"faster,\" as well as a steady hand.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Another \"take\" - another creative angle and perspective on this same subject and scene, is represented in the next photo example below. Here I focused only on the hands of this young boy working in a factory in Dhaka. You can see how changing aperture setting and - thus - depth of field, alters the emphasis of the composition, dramatically. I shot this photo at both f-stop 5.6 and then again at f-stop 1.4 (shown), but like the impact brought by the latter, best. Of course the photographer can then alternate the focus to the eyes, leaving the fingers out of focus (soft focus) for yet another interpretation of the scene. My suggestion to you is to experiment with it all in your work.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>At the other end of the aperture spectrum (higher f-stop numbers) you, of course, gain a different view - another perspective on the situation. In the next picture, for instance, I wanted to show ALL the figures and their activities, as well as give the viewer a sense of the space involved in this scene. To reach my vision, I set the aperture of my lens at f-11, to keep all from foreground to far background in the sharpest of focus.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>For the following picture, I turned to shutter speed to help me interpret the shot. This time, however, the \"street\" was really a train track running near the Bangladeshi capital. Often when trains are full or people haven\'t the money for a ticket, they will jump on top or ride on the linkages between cars - all very dangerous, of course. My aim was to show the speed of the train these daredevils were riding. I first, too, had to ride like them and it wasn\'t easy to do, especially trying to hand-hold my camera steady enough for a shot at 1/30 or 1/15 sec. With such situations it\'s best to shoot as many frames from as many perspectives as possible and then to edit your work with a most critical eye. Few of my images turned out exactly how I\'d planned, but the ones that did, were quite incredible. Emphasizing shutter speed over aperture control settings can add greatly to your photography of the street.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>One photograph that makes use of a <em>layering </em>effect to create visual interest, is that of the scene below. Here I positioned a painted rickshaw canopy in the immediate foreground of the photo and other elements in the background of the composition, to create a bit of visual <em>tension</em> and <em>energy</em>, as the viewer\'s eye moves between the two.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Yet another photograph where perspective was an important tool of expression for me, is that appearing below. I wanted to portray this brick factory worker from the back, in order to emphasize his \"faceless\" identity as a laborer in the brick industry of Bangladesh. I push myself very hard to get each shot I make. I\'m always looking for new and more creative perspectives to photograph from. And - I encourage you to do the same.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>A keen <em>sense of timing</em> is another trait of value in street photography.&nbsp; Be a concentrated observer, anticipate what will happen next and you will come away with photos like that below. Shot in Bangladesh as well, I was keeping a sharp eye on this work situation when I spotted this shot <em>in-the-making</em>. When it actually occurred, I was ready and captured \"<em>the moment</em>,\" as it\'s often referred to. These peaks in the action, be they subtle or \"in your face,\" happen much more often than you\'d think. Be ready for them with a preset (shutter speed and aperture choice) camera and such special moments can give life to your work. Pay attention to both timing and the body language of your subject and your pictures will greatly benefit from it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>Perfecting the above techniques requires patience and practice. Applying them in a dedicated way is key to making street photographs that speak with impact and meaning.</p>',1,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 17:28:41','2015-05-21 12:17:29'),(163,53,'Exceeding the Sum of Parts',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Following threads. Tying it all together.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Our goal for this course has been to produce a body of street work - through observation, composition and developing a sense for just when to squeeze the shutter button - that communicates daily life in a unique and interesting way. The focus of this collection could be one single subject or the layout could include a series of strong, single images, held together by a single thematic thread of some kind. Such could be colour alone, or a particular quality of light, or a series of 12 to 20 images that are \"portraits\" of life in a particular place. All of this is up to you as to what your final visual statement will include.</p>\r\n<p>Once I personally reach this point, there are then practical matters to be considered. Should the work be produced in colour or black and white? Mixing the two is not an option. As one who makes a living from photography, I need to be very aware of the markets in which I could sell either. For the most part, black and white images are quite hard to sell these days, so the majority of my street work is created in colour.</p>\r\n<p>Think in terms of single, strong images when you make your layout selections. Use the \"pin them up around the bathroom or bedroom mirror process,\" if you need to. Take those that stand this test of time and place them on the floor or tabletop together. Select images taken from different angles and perspectives. Include variety in your street photography portfolio - head and shoulder close-up portraits, environmental portraits (showing person in immediate surrounding context), show interaction situations and reveal qualities of light and shadow, indicating the time of day at which your photos were taken. Start with the weakest of your photographs - pull them out first and go to the next weakest and so on. Ask friends and family to help out with this - more eyes, the better. Once you\'ve removed all the shots you can in this way, go with what is left. These are then your strongest street images.</p>\r\n<p>So as a body of work, let\'s now take a final look at street images I made in Hamburg, Germany and Dhaka, Bangladesh, respectively. Keep in mind, that in the former I wanted to show the living situation of homeless people here.&nbsp; The aim of my street work was, indeed, to tell a story, as opposed to photos tied together by location or particular theme.&nbsp; With the second layout, my intent was to use single, strong photographs to depict daily street life in this South Asian capital city.</p>\r\n<p>From beginning to end, I spent a lot of time with my subjects for this story of the street. But for this investment, I received the payment of acceptance and greater access to make pictures. Therefore, in a very real sense, the six images below are their story, as interpreted photographically through my eyes.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>This first image above, as I\'ve mentioned earlier, is one of my favorites made during work on this project. There are several layers of interest to this photograph - the begging woman sitting on the sidewalk, the up-scale Nike advertisement in the sports shop behind her and a decisive moment in the bicycle streaming by. There\'s irony, there\'s social fact and there a lot of energy in this composition. And it is for this photo\'s strong blend of style and content, that I\'ve chosen to begin this essay - in<em> a visually exciting way</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Many of these homeless people, I learned, are completely alone. They are either separated for reasons from their families, or they simply don\'t have any - nor close relatives nearby. To fill in some warmth and friendship - and security, it is common for these people to have dogs and I wanted to record this for my story. A zoom telephoto lens gave me the chance to capture such a relationship at an optimum (i.e. defining moment) point in time.</p>\r\n<p>Once the context of the street is set for this short story (first photo) and the need for companionship is touched on (second photo), I thought it important to say something about how the homeless and jobless make their way in Hamburg - and similarly, a lot of other parts of the world, as well. The third photo abover is at once a statement about the place of the homeless in the larger society, as well as their invisibility to society at large. Where homeless people do find a sense of community, is among their own and this human connection is what I was after in the fourth photo of this collection.</p>\r\n<p>The fifth photograph was included because of its close-up perspective.&nbsp; It brings a change in rhythm to the layout. It adds a more \"intimate\" vantage point to the story. At such range, the viewer can see the detailed \"grittiness\" of life lived by people of this social category.</p>\r\n<p>The closing photograph of this sequence took quite a bit of time and effort to make. Unlike most of the pictures I made of this subject, this shot was taken inside, in a vacant building where some of these people found shelter at the end of their day. Just this context alone adds a different perspective to the story - the type of novel perspective that you as a street photographer should always be on the lookout for.</p>\r\n<p>The Dhaka series below represents a take on daily life on the streets (and waterways) of this city - in all its many variants.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>I began the Dhaka collection with this first image for a number of reasons. To begin, it is a vertical shot (portrait format) and could be placed as a magazine cover photograph - something I am always conscious of in my line of work. I like the use of colour here, too. The red and yellow combination makes the portrait really stand out. I also like the intensity of this woman\'s eyes. Her direct look into my lens brings a direct connection with the viewer, something that draws the reader into the series for a more in-depth exploration.</p>\r\n<p>A typical street scene is depicted in the next photo. Through its intense colours, this image adds visual excitement to the group and ties in nicely with the opening shot. From a professional\'s perspective, the main subject (street vendor peeling fruit) has been positioned slightly right of center to allow the photo to be used as a double-page spread (\"<em>double-truck</em>\"), without any destruction.</p>\r\n<p>The third photo here also plays on the colour red and the round form, to tie it into the series. I am a colour photographer and intense hues are an important means of expression for me in my pictures. I took this photo because represents a different angle - different perspective - from which to look at things on the streets of Dhaka. This is kind of middle-distance, abstract shot that shows a different side of life here.</p>\r\n<p>Photo 4 in this series brings a different perspective, still. This time it\'s <em>temporal</em> rather than <em>spacial</em> in quality. With this image I wanted to show nighttime on a busy city street and how some unfortunates are apt to spend it - here awaiting stopped traffic to ask for money from the drivers. Note once again, that the vibrant red that fills this frame ties it well to many of the other entries. Vary your looks at life in a street context. Don\'t limit yourself by either time or place. Get out there and show it all as it is at - anytime of the day or night.</p>\r\n<p>Carrying this body of work still farther is the next to last photograph. In this garbage dump on the edge of Dhaka, a woman holding her baby picks through piles of rubbish to salvage anything she can of value to sell. The rich orangish-red light orchestrates with pictures before this one. Main subject placement is similar and the rush of birds overhead echoes the energy generated by cars streaming by in the night, as seen in the previous photo. Camera angle (low) and timing to include a sense of moment in the frame, add to the dynamic feel of this picture.</p>\r\n<p>This body of work concludes with an overview - a <em>scene-setter</em> of the old city - Dhaka. Not a powerful image in the technical sense, this photograph merits inclusion based mainly on its contextual value. It gives the viewer an idea of where everything else in the collection is happening. The image adds atmospheric value to all the rest.</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-25 17:30:09','2015-03-25 17:54:15'),(164,54,'Gearing Up for the Night Sky',NULL,'<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Whether you photograph in a city or in the countryside, identifying the right time of night to photograph is your first challenge. The first lesson will have you photographing at night when you thought capturing a properly exposed image was impossible. You will learn how to recognize the light of dusk or twilight and the light of night, which is between dusk and sunrise, how pollution affects the exposure and the color of the night sky, and how to conquer the challenges of photographing in the city with all its mixed light sources, and in the countryside with no or limited artificial light.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Lesson 1:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Get organized and be patient. When photographing especially at night you must be organized. Remember you are working in the dark, perhaps in the cold using long exposures from seconds to minutes.&nbsp; Pack your equipment carefully. I label all my equipment with bright orange tape. For example all my lenses are labeled, as are my different camera bodies, and all my small items such as remotes are placed in small see through bags that are also labeled. I also have a minimum of two flash lights, one that is devoted to illuminating my equipment in my camera bag, and a second light &ndash; a headlamp that I wear. I use a LED Lenser P7 flashlight when painting with light or when I need a very bright light.</p>\r\n<p>I mainly prefer to work at dusk or when the sky has some brightness, referred to as Nautical Twilight. Photographing on a clear cool or cold night and under the light of a full moon renders a deep blue sky. Photographing under an overcast sky renders a lower contrast more diffused image with a warmer colorcast. My below photographs #1 from Cuba, #2 from Mongolia and #4 from Uzbekistan, have a deep blue sky and all these photographs were shot on a clear cool night, with no pollution.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Photographs # 3 and # 5, both from Beijing show hazy skies, photographed on very warm nights with polluted skies. These have a warm colorcast from the incandescent &ndash; sodium vapor - streetlights, and photograph # 5 is photographed under mixed light.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The last photograph # 6, of the Sankore Mosque in Timbuktu was taken on a hazy warm night under incandescent light producing the orange colorcast.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Large cities with plenty of illumination from streetlights, building lights and other sources provide lots of ambient light. Whether you choose to photograph on a clear night or an overcast night, there should be sufficient light to provide an evenly exposed image. The clouds on an overcast night act as a large soft box diffusing the light, reducing contrast.</p>\r\n<p>In cities I try not to shoot directly into streetlights, although sometimes this is hard to avoid. I first decide which direction to point my camera, and then I frame the scene. Usually my camera is pointed towards the area of the sky that is relatively even in exposure or where the sky is a deep blue. In major cities on an overcast night the clouds act as a soft box reflecting the warm color of the sodium vapor lights. I always head out to look for my images about half an hour before dusk. I use <a href=\"http://www.dateandtime.com\">www.dateandtime.com</a>, which provides me with worldwide weather reports, sun and moon phases, and dusk and twilight times. In Photograph # 1 above from Trinidad, Cuba I noticed and wanted to capture the light from open door, and the brightness of the deep blue sky. The white line at the bottom is light from a car&rsquo;s headlamp. I framed the scene and waited for cars to pass. As cars drove through the frame I made several exposures, until I got the image I wanted.

You will learn how to capture or show motion as in Photograph #3, my Cuban Man Descending Staircase and photograph #4 Man Making Chai Tea (both below), how to paint with light with either a flashlight or using your strobe unit, and how to use the strobe unit as a fill light to create a natural look. For this lesson you will need a tripod, a flashlight and/or a strobe unit.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s start with how to capture motion at night. My Photograph #1 (below), which is the Old Walled City in Baku, Azerbaijan, and my Photograph #3 (above), The Man Descending Staircase from Havana, Cuba were unexpected. Similar to my Trinidad, Cuba Street Corner Photograph #1 from Lesson 1, the people just appeared. Originally I was just photographing the street scenes but when the people appeared I knew their addition would add a more interesting element to my images. In both situations my camera was on a tripod, ISO 100, 30 seconds at F8. Capturing the motion is a combination of shutter speed, how fast the subject is moving and the light on the subject.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 2.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old Walled City, Baku, Azerbaijan</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Cuban Man Descending a Staircase was also serendipitous. I was Initially photographing the stairwell when the man appeared. I quickly incorporated him in the scene. With my camera on the tripod and using a relatively slow shutter speed I asked the man to repeat walking down the stairs. This allowed me to determine the correct shutter speed to capture his motion. My setting for The Man Descending Staircase was ISO 200, 1 second at F4, and I used a wide-angle lens providing greater depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 2.3&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Man Descending Staircase, Havana, Cuba</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Painting With Light:</strong></p>\r\n<p>In my Photograph #2 below, the Ger Camp in Mongolia I used a flashlight to add exposure to both sides of the tents. You can see the light from my headlamp as I walk in front of the Ger on the left. My technique for painting with light is to start with the ambient exposure. The longer the exposure the more time I have to walk into the scene to add light. I either use my strobe unit or a flashlight to paint with light. Now I mainly use my strobe unit. I start by taking an exposure and then evaluative which area needs more exposure. I use the longest shutter speed possible allowing me time to walk into the scene to paint with light, and then I calculate the Aperture setting.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 2.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ger Camp, Lake Hovsgol, Mongolia</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Using a Flashlight:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Using a powerful flashlight I move or paint the light over the dark areas of the scene &ndash; similar to burning in when printing in the darkroom or burning in with Photoshop or Lightroom. If I am too far away from the dark areas I will walk into the scene. Painting with the light from a flashlight takes some practice and feel, and depends on the power of your flashlight. If you paint too quickly the light may be insufficient, if you paint too slowly the light will be visible. Using a shutter speed in the seconds allows enough time for you to walk into the scene.<br /><br />My below Image 2.4 of a Man Making Chai Tea in Lahore, Pakistan is where I am using my strobe unit as a fill light. I set my camera to the ambient reading, in this situation ISO 400 1/15 at F5.6, and my strobe unit is set to TTL &ndash; 2. The slow shutter captured the ambient or background detail and the strobe unit froze the stream of tea. <br />This takes practice and experience. Several test shots may be required to determine which shutter speed, aperture setting and strobe power will render the desired effect.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 2.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Man Making Chai Tea, Lahore, Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Using a Strobe Unit:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Using a strobe unit is somewhat more reliable in that you can set your flash unit to a specific amount of light, although this does not guarantee that the exposure will be correct. Proper exposure is determined by the correct amount of light from the strobe unit, camera exposure and the subject brightness. This technique requires practice and feel.</p>\r\n<p>Find a scene that has an area that is too dark. This may be an area that is back-lit or darker than a brighter area. The concept is to match the flash unit output to the F/stop of the lens. For example if the ambient exposure is 15 seconds at F5.6, set your flash unit to 5.6. I suggest using your strobe unit in the automatic mode, which is easier and provides a range of distances for the strobe to be from the subject. In the automatic mode the back of the flash unit shows a range of distances based on the aperture setting. For example at a setting of f5.6 the distance scale may show F5.6 is good for a range of between 4ft. to 15 ft. That means that as long as the strobe unit is within this range the strobe output will be F5.6. <br /><br />If your strobe unit does not have an automatic mode, and some strobe units no longer provide an automatic mode, use the manual mode. In the manual mode it is strobe to subject distance. For example at F5.6 the strobe distance scale may show it is good at a distance of 15ft. This means the strobe must be at a distance of 15 ft. to output F5.6 worth of light. You have no room for error.</p>\r\n<p>Using a strobe unit to paint with light is similar to using a flashlight. You are adding light to selected areas. To fire your strobe unit press the test button, wait until the ready light reappears before you fire your strobe unit again. The caveat is that the light from your strobe unit at small aperture settings, such as F8, F11 or F16 will not travel very far and the strobe unit takes longer to recycle. You will notice it takes longer for the ready light to appear. However, when painting with light I rarely use small aperture settings. I mostly set my flash unit to around F 4 or F5.4, for faster recycling time and allowing me to add light faster to more areas.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-26 13:06:32','2015-03-26 17:47:55'),(166,54,'Mastering the Strobe',NULL,'<p>Now that you feel confidant working in the dark lets move on to how to use your strobe unit on and off camera, and as the main source of light and as a fill light. Having a wireless strobe system or third part transreceivers will be useful for this lesson and for Lesson #4. Rarely, do I use my strobe unit on my camera. Not never but rarely. And most of time my strobe is a fill light. Most often I work with ambient light and I want the ambient light to be part of the scene. <br /><br />The first two below Images 3.1 &amp; 3.2 of a Steel Mill worker, illustrate the look with strand without strobe. They are different images. For both images the camera was on the tripod, and I started with the ambient exposure. In the second image I am using my strobe unit as the main source of light, setting my strobe unit to TTL 0 or matching my strobe unit output to the aperture setting on my lens. Using my strobe unit as the main source of light or setting the strobe unit to TTL 0 causes the man to be brighter than the background. Another way to achieve this look is to under expose the background by using a faster shutter. Often this is the method I use to make my subject brighter than an underexposed or slightly darker background. Also in this photograph the strobe unit is off the camera on my left side. You will notice the light falls on one side of the steel workers face.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 3.1&nbsp; Lahore, Pakistan Steel Mill, Pakistan No Strobe</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Steel Mill, Lahore, Pakistan with Strobe</strong></p>\r\n<p>The next two below photographs employ the strobe as main source of light technique, even thought one image is indoors and the other image is outdoors.&nbsp; For example, in the first Image 3.3 of the Monk in a classroom, the interior setting or the small white room contains the light from the strobe, adding exposure to the overall scene. To control the additional exposure I used a faster shutter speed, in this situation 1/60. In this photograph I am hand holding my camera and hand holding my strobe unit at TTL 0, directing the strobe unit to the boys right side &ndash; the viewer&rsquo;s left side -, illuminating one side of the boy&rsquo;s face. My strobe unit also had a small soft box that helped direct and soften the light.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 3.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monk in a classroom, Laos</strong></p>\r\n<p>In my below Image 3.4 of Haji on Ghiragh Din St. Lahore, Pakistan, I captured Hajji quickly and spontaneously in the street. I am always ready with my camera set to the ambient exposure or if I need to a slightly faster shutter speed in this case 1/15 to freeze motion, with my strobe unit set to TTL 0.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Haji on Ghiragh Din St. Lahore, Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the below Image 3.5 of the Ganga Ram Hospital entrance I combined ambient light or the background light with the strobe. The girl on the far left is illuminated by the strobe, which highlights her face and freezes the subjects movement creating the ghosting effect. I started with the ambient reading for my camera&rsquo;s exposure and my flash was set to TTL -1.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Image 3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ganga Ram Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan</strong></p>\r\n<p>I am not afraid to hand hold my camera at long shutter speeds. Often my lens of choice is a wide-angle lens. A wide-angle lens is small and lighter in weight, allowing me to handle hold without much camera shake. The wide-angle lens allows me to use wider aperture settings in low light situations, and provides more depth of field.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Strobe Basics - Strobe as the Main Source of Light:</strong><br /><br />The strobe unit becomes the main source of light when the ambient exposure is too low or is unusable; for example the shutter speed is too low to hand hold or the exposure will show unwanted ghosting or you want the subject to be brighter than the background. When the strobe is the main source of light you set the strobe unit to TTL 0 or match the strobe output to the lens aperture setting. <br /><br />When the strobe is the main source of light you select the shutter speed and aperture required. For example in most situations I use ISO 100 or ISO 200 at 1/30 or 1/60 at F5.6 or F8. These settings are just examples. The smaller and brighter the room or the setting the faster allow me to use a shutter speed and a smaller aperture setting. The larger the room and the darker the setting I use a slower shutter speed and a wider aperture setting. And throughout these settings my strobe unit is TTL 0. <br /><br /><strong>Strobe as a Fill Light:</strong></p>\r\n<p>When the strobe unit is a fill light, it is filling in or adding light therefore exposure into the shadow parts of the scene. When the strobe unit is a fill light you are using your strobe unit in a minus setting, such as TTL -1, -2 or -3. My recipes depend on your camera&rsquo;s sensor and the power of your strobe unit. This you will have to experiment with. In general the more powerful strobe units such as Nikon&rsquo;s SB900/910 and Canon&rsquo;s RT600 I recommend TTL -2, -3 or using in manual mode at 1/16 power for less light. Nikon&rsquo;s SB700 is a less powerful strobe that I recommend setting at TTL -1 or even TTL 0. Nikon&rsquo;s SB800 and Canon&rsquo;s EX880 strobe units I recommend setting at TTL -2. Again you must experiment with the different strobe settings in different lighting situations and in different environments. </p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-26 13:07:44','2015-03-26 17:54:04'),(167,54,'\"Light\" is the Language',NULL,'<p><strong>Putting It All Together:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s combine all the techniques discussed in the above lessons with framing and composition to create images that reflect your personal vision.

First lesson photograph from different heights, low to high and high to low. The placement of the railing broke the frame into thirds. Second lesson break the frame into thirds or more. Using a wide-angle lens provided great depth of field and a layering of the different elements in the scene. Third lesson to create depth use a wide-angle lens. I used a wide-angle lens at a small aperture setting to provide greater depth of field. Fourth lesson work the viewer&rsquo;s eye into the scene. Use an element to work the viewer&rsquo;s eye into the scene.

Once your own portfolio of images is underway, you\'ll be able find new faces in agencies, modeling schools or through model scouts.&nbsp; Find the most photogenic young person you can, as it is - more than anything else - the face that makes the picture.&nbsp; Casting is key.&nbsp; The images you take will not only represent the model but will present you and your skills as a model photographer.</p>\r\n<p>Agencies have specific requirements, which are standard throughout the industry.&nbsp; Images need to be age-appropriate to the model and should not be overtly \"sexy\" or \"cheesy.\"&nbsp; The model should be simply dressed and without too much hair styling and make-up and without hat or sunglasses.&nbsp; Posing should be natural. The eyes should be calm and the expression, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Backgrounds used should not distract from the model, but often a simple wall can make a picture look like a \"mug shot.\"&nbsp; The ideal spot is a place where someone would normally stand, sit or lean.&nbsp; The aim is to&nbsp; give the model a more relaxed body position, so he or she they can concentrate on their facial expressions.&nbsp; \"Open shade\" (e.g. that found beneath a shady tree or awning on a sunny day) and the use of a reflector to bounce in additional light, can be quite flattering.&nbsp; Such also makes it easier for the model to open their eyes - and if you prefer, a flash (on- or off-camera) can be used for fill light, too.&nbsp; However when adding the latter, avoid having the flash leave a shadow outlining the model, against a wall.&nbsp; As for \"settings,\" local parks, fields, alleyways, steps and stairs in urban settings, are all good starting points for location choice.&nbsp; Lastly, be sure to scout-out locations ahead of your shoot to ensure that the light will be as you want it, at that specific time of day.</p>\r\n<p>The images below were all shot with models belonging to the \"new faces\" category.&nbsp; The light was that of morning and the location was a series of local parks in the Miami, Florida area.&nbsp; I shot with an 85mm, f1.8 lens set to aperture f2.8 and my Canon 5D camera was set to capture RAW files at ISO 400.&nbsp; The wide aperture setting was made to soften / blur the background, but note that the same sort of blurred background can be achieved by making sure there is a large distance between the model and the background.</p>\r\n<p>First Model:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Second Model:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Since these were both young women, I kept their clothing simple and age-appropriate, opting for shorts, tank tops and blouses, avoiding too much pattern or prints.&nbsp; These are items they brought themselves from their own wardrobes.&nbsp; Young models tend to wear modern casual clothes so I always ask them to bring a variety of items to the shoot - such as jeans, blouses, tank tops, shorts, mini skirts, and other things they love to wear and feel good in.&nbsp; Long limbs are essential for models so I avoid covering them up too much, if I can.&nbsp; For example - if the model is wearing skinny jeans, I make sure she has bare arms.&nbsp; Or if she is wearing a larger shirt, I put it with something that shows off her legs.&nbsp; \"Proportion\" is important so the model doesn&rsquo;t look too naked or lost in a pile of layers.</p>\r\n<p>I wanted to emphasize their beautiful skin and long hair, so I shot in open-shade, under trees in morning sunlight. It\'s okay if small patches of light hit the face, as long as it isn&rsquo;t distracting or unflattering in any way. Make sure the model is able to open their eyes without squinting.&nbsp; Calm eyes give the model a dreamy, relaxed quality.&nbsp; The eyes have to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the camera and be interesting and confident in appearance.</p>\r\n<p>Besides, this, the model should have a soft expression in the mouth and jaw.&nbsp; Sometimes a model will tense-up their lips or jawline when shooting.&nbsp; When this happens, I find that if they close their lips without clenching their teeth, it makes them have a more pleasing look.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes it\'s possible to work with the wind to animate the hair, but other times you have to create a wind effect.&nbsp; I frequently ask someone to wave the reflector&nbsp;or large piece of cardboard close to the model to give the hair some lift, in a natural way.&nbsp; To show off the cheek bones, which are the hallmark of a photogenic face, it is good to open the face by having the hair away from it - not touching the face too much, but framing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For young women, simple grooming for a test means clean and basically styled hair, concealed blemishes (with a light product and powder), blotting papers for shiny skin (instead of lots of powder which shows in digital images), tidy eyebrows, mascara and lightly-applied lip gloss or lip balm.&nbsp; Young guys should have a freshly shaved face, groomed eyebrows, concealed blemishes, wear lip balm and sport a good professional haircut.</p>\r\n<p>Shoulders and a long neck give a graceful, almost dancer-like quality to models, as well.&nbsp; Position your camera so that you don&rsquo;t distort the neck or make it disappear all together.&nbsp; Shooting from too far above or too far below the eye-level of the model will create a distortion that could make the neck vanish or, alternately, make the head much too small in relation to the shoulders.&nbsp; If the model tilts his or her head at all, make sure it isn&rsquo;t too much, as a face turned on it&rsquo;s side looks like neither the photographer or the model knew really what would look professional.&nbsp; A confident model with an asymmetrical face can look straight into the camera with shoulders squared and look - amazing!</p>\r\n<p>If a model has nice hands and graceful gestures, try some frames where they have their hands near their face, just for some variation.&nbsp; Make sure they don&rsquo;t hide any part of the face at all, just enhance the overall image.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let the model squash their face or chin onto a hand or fist.&nbsp; The trick is to give the impression that the model is leaning on a hand, not actually applying pressure to the face. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />If a model has trouble achieving a calm face, try asking her to imitate the expression of the Mona Lisa.&nbsp; Everyone knows this picture and it brings to mind just what expression, confident eyes, slight smile, long neck and beautiful overall look, are called for.&nbsp; I get great looks out of models when I tell them to channel their inner Mona Lisa.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-27 07:21:06','2015-03-27 10:23:25'),(169,55,'Locations, Model Direction, Lighting',NULL,'<p>My photography teacher told me that one of the most important elements of a photo shoot, is to see the images in your mind before you ever start shooting.&nbsp; The aim is to have a clear direction of what you want to do - to have a plan and treat it like an assignment.&nbsp; Doing so will allow your creativity to come out once the ball is rolling, so you can take advantage of the circumstances each shoot presents. <br /><br />With each model test you do, your goal should be to grow as a photographer and to add more interesting images to your portfolio.&nbsp; During a typical test, you should aim to have a variety of full-length images, portraits, movement shots and to show variations in the light - how it plays on the model&rsquo;s skin and hair.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes it can be hard to think of a creative angle or approach - on the spot, so the more well informed you are, the better.&nbsp; Magazines, blogs and model agency websites are great places to research images that are strong.&nbsp; In addition, these sites can inspire you to reach and stretch your skills.&nbsp; Try keeping a file of images on your computer that you can refer back to - to give you ideas about location, styling, lighting, hair and make-up, etc. Read magazines constantly to keep up on, not just fashion trends, but visual trends so that you know what style of photography is current and looks new.&nbsp; Everyone is always looking for the &ldquo;new&rdquo;.&nbsp; The idea is not to copy these images, but to be inspired by them.&nbsp; No copied image is ever as good as the original, as all the elements that went into that image are not at all what you will have on your own shoot, so shoot your own original concepts.&nbsp; At the same time be very aware of what looks fresh and interesting in the market - <em>NOW</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Another advantage to educating yourself visually, is to learn what angles and body positions work for models.&nbsp; Clients want models to have long limbs, square shoulders, posture, graceful movements and eyes that &ldquo;talk&rdquo;.&nbsp; A model can&rsquo;t use an image that makes her legs look short or squat, just as she can&rsquo;t use images that distort her in any way - including her face.&nbsp; Where the photographer stands and directs the lens in relation to the model, can completely alter her appearance.&nbsp; If she is less that 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; or 175cm tall, it can then be to the model\'s advantage to make her legs appear long and lean.&nbsp; For this, you might want to position yourself at her waistline or slightly lower, to better capture this kind of look.&nbsp; If the model has a really square jawline, then a portrait where she turns her head off-center a bit, would be more feminine and flattering than a direct-to-camera shot.&nbsp; When you do your research, note how the model is positioned and why it works, then emulate that in your own approach.</p>\r\n<p>It is important for a testing photographer to have a few basic items ready to use depending on the location and concept.&nbsp; I like to keep a large white or grey sheet, a wooden crate, a reflector, plastic chip bag clips with rubber tips, safety pins and sticky tape, handy.&nbsp; You can hang the sheet on a wall with the tape, use the clips and pins to hold the models clothes in place, the wooden crate for the model to sit on, etc.&nbsp; Another item that works well in certain circumstances, are sheer curtain panels that can give a dreamy quality to your set and look interesting when they catch the wind.&nbsp; Learn to be inventive with your backgrounds, while not distracting from the model.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have a general concept in mind for your next shoot, the model chosen, styling planned out and the location picked, give yourself a list of things you would like to accomplish in that shoot.&nbsp; For example, you might want to concentrate on portraits, movement and full-length shots.&nbsp; Directing the model is key in getting her to be an active participant in the creative process.&nbsp; As you are about to shoot, discuss with her what you are aiming to do in that particular shot, so she can collaborate with you and actively play a part in the dialog.&nbsp; If you are shooting portraits, tell her where you are cropping the shot and explain - in a simple manner - what you would like her to do with her eyes and expression.&nbsp; If you are shooting full-length, explain the body position you would like her to assume and then allow her to change it up a bit herself - just to keep her natural and inspired.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let a model get stuck in a rut, where she doesn&rsquo;t know what you are trying to shoot and can&rsquo;t visualize it in the least.&nbsp; Time-to-time, show the model the image on the camera and explain to her why you like the shot, letting her know she is on the right track or what she could be doing differently.&nbsp; While you don&rsquo;t want to remove the creative process from your own hands, keep in mind that you are working as \"a team\" and the model\'s unique qualities can really add to the image, if you work in harmony together.</p>\r\n<p>On the shoot in the photos below, I took my model to a local park at the edge of the beach.&nbsp; We shot along the water&rsquo;s edge in the morning light as it twinkled on the water.&nbsp; The backlighting really suited her complexion and hair.&nbsp; The wind animated both her clothes and hair, which added a soft quality to the images.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>We next worked onto movement shots (below), in order to showcase this model\'s dancer-like look and ability to move gracefully.&nbsp; If a model is stiff or awkward, it is up to you to make her confident enough to get moving &ndash; and sometimes that awkwardness can be eye-catching if you are able to capture it in an interesting way.&nbsp; My model is an actual dancer, so movement is quite easy for her and that shines through in these type of shots.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>I shoot portraits whenever I can, even if it means interrupting a full-length shot to change lenses to an 85mm, to do it.&nbsp; If the hair, expression, background and lighting are all coming together into a nice beauty shot, I\"ll grab it while I can.&nbsp; Spontaneity sometimes gives a better image that a carefully planned idea. I get the model to angle her chin, play with her eyes and lips and I move her around until the light is just right to capture it all.&nbsp; Models feed off the energy of a photographer, who is obviously inspired and creative.&nbsp; And no one minds hearing the photographer gasp when something is really pretty in the camera! <br /><br />My model on this day was not the typical height for a fashion model, so I employed visual tricks to make her appear taller.&nbsp; I asked her to put on a short skirt and heels and silhouetted her against a background where she would stand out (photos below).&nbsp; I shot from just below her waist and asked her not to look down at me, as that makes the eyes look hooded and dark.&nbsp; I asked her to vary leg and hand positions and reminded her to pay attention to her expression, which is still extremely important even in a full-length image.&nbsp; Models have to model from the top of their head to the tips of their toes - in every single shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget to let the model&rsquo;s personality come shining through.&nbsp; Let her smile and laugh, let her use her hands and gestures to personalize a shoot.&nbsp; She is a story and together your shoot is like a \"mini-movie,\" with her being \"The Star.\"&nbsp; Let her beauty and nature come through in the images and you will have a happy model and agency, not to mention great shots for your own growing portfolio.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-27 07:23:31','2015-04-24 10:01:59'),(170,55,' The \"Fashion Edge\"',NULL,'<p>Photographers who want to break into fashion and beauty photography need to build a strong portfolio with beautiful models.&nbsp;

This area appealed to me because there were lots of graphic elements that would make the images interesting.&nbsp; I particularly liked the reflective surfaces and the way the light was hitting them, creating vivid colors.&nbsp; I took photos to keep track of the colors, graphic elements and possible shooting angles so that I could refer back to them while arranging the model and the styling.&nbsp; I also noted the time of day when the light would be in my favor. &nbsp;<br /><br />The next step is to cast your model.&nbsp; Sometimes a great way to start is with the model first as they often have a distinct style that requires little transformation.&nbsp; Other times you will have your idea in mind and will need to look for just the right model who you think can pull it off.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you live in an area with fashion stylists and make-up artists you can approach them and ask them if they would be interested in collaborating on this creative project with you.&nbsp; They must also work on their own portfolios and it is a great way for everyone to grow their books and learn in the process.&nbsp; When those artists are not available, you can style the model yourself, noting the clothing and shoes sizes and perhaps having the model bring specific items to the shoot.&nbsp; I asked my stylist to bring short dresses and high heel shoes in graphic prints and solid colors as I wanted to show the model&rsquo;s long legs, arms and neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I showed the stylist my simple location images to give an idea of the possible backgrounds.<br /><br />Make-up artists can add a high-fashion element to a photo shoot.&nbsp; Collaboration can bring lots of ideas to a production but it is important that everyone is on the same page and that the styling, the model the location, and the hair and make-up all compliment each other.&nbsp; If not, the shoot will look amateur.&nbsp; Planning ahead and sharing inspirations helps to keep everyone on the same page and with the same vision in mind.&nbsp; Some models, if shown image examples, can replicate looks on themselves and this can really help if make-up and hair artists are not available.&nbsp; Be informed about what is in style at the moment both with fashion and beauty so that you don&rsquo;t look like you are unaware of what is happening in the editorial and advertising world.</p>\r\n<p>The location we used below lent itself to making graphic images: tile work on the ground, curved glass, colored windows, and interesting metal features.&nbsp; It also made a juxtaposition between the model and the background.&nbsp; She is quite feminine and yet the background is urban and a bit cold.&nbsp; I kept the color tones relatively cool to make her pop even more from the background.&nbsp; The contrast between the model and her environment is eye-catching and shows off the styling.&nbsp; Sometimes taking the fashion out of the obvious context makes for a more memorable image.&nbsp; It is less literal and shows creativity and your evolving vision.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}<br /><br />Time to shoot!&nbsp; You have your model, your styling and make-up and hair sorted out and all systems are go.&nbsp; Everyone knows the plan and are working together to make some magic.&nbsp; For our shoot, we prepared the model at home and brought the clothes to change into on set.&nbsp; We began at ten in the morning on a sunny day and shot for three hours, including time for the model to change, for the hair and make-up to be adjusted, etc. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />It is important to always make the model long and lean without distorting or deforming her so I used angles for emphasis on her long legs.&nbsp; In the image with the red dress, she is sitting on the ground with her legs at an angle in the shot. I am standing on a ledge shooting down on her with a 50mm lens, the sun being almost on top of her as it was about eleven o&rsquo;clock, and we put a silver reflector in front of her to fill in the shadows.&nbsp; I also angled her on the black and white tile pattern on the ground so that the tiles would sweep through the image rather than be horizontal stripes.&nbsp; It really makes the red dress pop out of the shot and the eyes are drawn down her legs to the black shoes anchoring the image in the bottom right corner. &nbsp;<br /><br />Movement is a great way to make an image dynamic and visually interesting.&nbsp; My model is graceful so I got her to repeat a simple long stride as if she is jumping out of the glass sculpture.&nbsp; I made sure her left foot did not go out of the frame completely.&nbsp; I sat on the ground and used my 24mm-70mm lens set at 40mm, so I was about six feet away from her shooting up.&nbsp; The tile on the ground was very bright so we didn&rsquo;t need to use a reflector for bounce.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are shooting in shade or on a grey day, a small fill flash can do wonders for this type of movement shot.&nbsp; I asked her to remember to model with all of her body and face, being aware of her expression, arms and hand gestures, and opening her shoulder to the camera so we could see more of her.&nbsp; If her right arm was leading we would not be able to see her dress well and if her left leg was leading we might have gotten an eye full as the dress was quite short.&nbsp; Another thing to keep in mind is that you want to capture the model before her leading foot hits the ground as gravity pushes all of the body on to that foot and makes things look really heavy, even with a skinny model.&nbsp; Try to capture her just as she is about to land and you will have long limbs, graceful movements and a light and energetic feeling to the image. &nbsp;<br /><br />We wanted to capture a beauty shot of our model (below) to show her make-up and long neck so we used a reflective window surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used my 85mm lens and a silver reflector and placed her quite close to the surface of the window.&nbsp; Her reflection added interest to the shot and in keeping with the other images we had already done, I asked her to not look into the lens but into the window, which told more of story.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br /><br />In post-production when I had edited my selected images, I made sure the color balance of the skin tone was consistent and removed any small blemishes on her skin that would be very apparent.&nbsp; It is important to shoot as correctly as you can in-camera so that you don&rsquo;t shoot randomly and rely on fixing things later in post-production.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t use software to save a shot that is a favorite but the light wasn&rsquo;t perfect or there was a tree or person in the shot that can be removed.&nbsp; Just make sure the image is created more in the camera than on the computer later or you will spend more time retouching than shooting.&nbsp; There are fashion image hybrid trends where everything is extremely manipulated but it still has to start with an actual image and for that you have to be a photographer first.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-27 07:29:19','2015-04-07 12:46:53'),(171,55,'Lighting Techniques - Photographic Range',NULL,'<p>Sometimes, weather or available locations, dictates we shoot either in a studio or in an interior location.&nbsp; This can work in your favor as it will show range of lighting technique in your portfolio, and means that you are not limited by your surroundings.&nbsp; As you know, many fashion editorials are shot in studio and it puts the focus more directly on the model, the make-up and the styling, For models, this provides a clean, simple background from which they can show their ability to move in front of the camera, adding some drama or interest to an otherwise plain environment.&nbsp; In places where the weather is cold or dark, this is a great way for models and photographers to work on their books indoors, either in a setting with windows and natural light, or in a studio set-up.</p>\r\n<p>Model tests done in studio can be styled very simply, using the model&rsquo;s own clothes.&nbsp; The make-up and hair should stay natural, putting focus directly on the model&rsquo;s &ldquo;look&rdquo; and ability to be expressive with her eyes and body movements.&nbsp; The makeup and styling should not be distracting.&nbsp; A model and photographer can use this sort of portraiture for a long time in their portfolios as long as the clothing and hair stay current and classic.&nbsp; Keep in mind that long limbs, beautiful expressions in the eyes, and graceful body gestures will be what the agency is looking for in the images.&nbsp; The models in my own examples are wearing simple things like jeans, tank tops, shorts, sweaters and slips.&nbsp; Even though some shots show lingerie, it is tasteful and not overtly sexy in any way.</p>\r\n<p>Black and white images tend to have a more editorial quality for models and fashion, and can often hide shortcomings or distractions of the location.&nbsp; It also allows you to play with the lighting and shadows to give visual interest.&nbsp; Building a book showing a variety of lighting in studio or on location can open doors for fashion editorial assignments, and prepare you for projects where you might be thrown into an environment and expected to pull off a great fashion story, working with whatever elements you have at hand.&nbsp; It also gives you the technical tools needed to further a fashion photography career where studio photographers develop unique lighting styles to differentiate themselves from others.</p>\r\n<p>Take a look around you for a space where you could set up a small studio, or for rooms where the available light is pleasing.&nbsp; In some cities testing photographers use their apartment windows, friend&rsquo;s apartment windows, corridors, garages, etc., to do shots with local models.&nbsp; The most important element is to use the light in a way that you can control how it falls on the model, to minimize the visual distractions of the background, and to have white panels for fill when the strobes or window light isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\r\n<p>In my first example below we shot in a friend&rsquo;s home where there was beautiful light coming in a large bedroom window.&nbsp; We added fill with a white panel to make sure the light was soft and flattering yet kept the definition in the model&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; We wanted to show the playfulness of her personality so we kept her laughing and looking away from the camera to add sweetness and fun to the image. She is sexy enough without forcing it with her facial expression or body language.&nbsp; In this case, &ldquo;natural&rdquo; was much more interesting.&nbsp; Nothing is exaggerated.&nbsp; The contrasting trim of the sweater mimicked the mats and frames of the photos on the wall behind her and added a graphic quality to the image.&nbsp; Another item that can be very useful in your home studio kit can be plain sheer white curtains or panels which can be purchased at home goods stores for very little cost.&nbsp; These can be taped over a window to act as a diffuser.&nbsp; You can also put two side by side and use them as curtains to frame the model and allow portions of light to stream through in places, keeping other areas shaded.&nbsp; They can also conceal parts of the location that are less appealing.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In my next example, the model is wearing a simple black slip, sitting on the wooden floor of my home with a white backdrop.&nbsp; She is sitting about six feet in front of the background.&nbsp; I used one strobe directed onto a white panel, bouncing back the light onto her left side, and another white panel without a strobe on her right side to fill in the shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also play with the curves in post-production to adjust the amount of shadow you have on the model to add detail if there isn&rsquo;t enough from the white fill panel.&nbsp; You can train your eye to see at what level the shadows add drama or definition.&nbsp; Too many shadows don&rsquo;t show enough of the model&rsquo;s features and will be less useful in their portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this example, the model&rsquo;s long neck, square shoulders and symmetry worked well when she faced the camera directly.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The following photo is of the same model. In this situation, I sat her on a wooden crate to give her some height and I placed her three feet from the backdrop.&nbsp; The image was exposed more brightly for this shot as I wanted it to be different from the previous example, showing the model in softer light.&nbsp; I directed her to use her hands in a manner that was delicate and not awkward, and to play with her eyes and expression.&nbsp; Because she has a delicacy about her I wanted to play up this vulnerability, which was a contrast from the strength of the image in the black slip dress.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Photo examples 4 and 5 below were shot in the same home studio, this time using a bright blue paper backdrop.&nbsp; I placed the model standing six feet away from the background and I lit her using an umbrella and strobe positioned three feet away, directed down on her at a 45 degree angle, slightly towards her right side.&nbsp; This particular model had a stronger look and I wanted to play up her bone structure and angles of her face.&nbsp; I directed her in such a way as to show off her figure and hair in a voluptuous way that was in keeping with her strong look, without crossing over in to pin-up territory.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>For all the model test images that you do, keep in mind what the agency really needs to promote the model and try to fulfill that so they will continue to use you in the future.&nbsp; There are a few rules that are consistent throughout the industry:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>models are &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, the industry is &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and the agencies want to look cooler than their competitors and to look like they have the edge, so don&rsquo;t try to impose your own personal style on tests until you have the support of the agency behind you;</li>\r\n<li>nothing &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; ever &ndash; no proper or legitimate agency wants to see their future top models shown in any compromising images;</li>\r\n<li>keep the model&rsquo;s age in mind and never shoot anything that isn&rsquo;t age-appropriate;</li>\r\n<li>images that have classic styling and natural hair and make-up will last a lot longer in the portfolio than a trendy shot;</li>\r\n<li>every image you give to the model and agency is a direct reflection back on you and your taste level so make certain you only give them your best work &ndash; when in doubt, leave it out &ndash; edit;</li>\r\n<li>be informed:&nbsp; look online and in magazines for the best in fashion photography.&nbsp; Know the top magazines and photographers and analyze their images.&nbsp; Educate yourself on the designers, brands and top fashion markets.&nbsp; Have these references, old and new, in your head at all times so that you can use what you have learned to grow your portfolio and develop your own personal style, each time you shoot.&nbsp; Tests are the training ground for fashion and beauty photographers so this is your time to learn.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>When you have seven or eight really good test images in your book that you have done with a new model or gorgeous friend you can present them to local agencies.&nbsp; Keep in mind that in the main fashion markets there are a lot of photographers ready to test models and it is much more competitive. Have something you can leave behind such a business card with a small photo on it, or a postcard size promotional card that you can give to agencies or post to billboards in local areas where young people go.&nbsp; Choose an image that is graphic and general and will appeal to a large demographic.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t list your fees or such details on the card, but direct people to call or email you for further information.&nbsp; List your website if you have one.</p>\r\n<p>Agencies will typically expect to receive a disc within three to four days with large jpegs, not retouched, and a few selects of your choice already retouched.&nbsp; Models&rsquo; portfolios are usually up to twelve inches tall by nine inches wide so the images must be at least that size and at 300dpi.&nbsp; I shoot four looks on a typical test, giving the agency about one hundred edits, and five retouched selects.&nbsp; If they choose to retouch other images on their own, the jpegs are large enough to do so.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-27 07:31:25','2015-03-27 10:30:14'),(172,56,'Lifestyle Photography and Why Smiles Sell',NULL,'<p>Lifestyle photography is all about re-creating REAL LIFE situations in a controlled setting, taking into careful consideration the important technical aspects of the shoot, from the conceptualisation, production, location, styling, casting and finally the shoot and the art or seeing and capturing the most natural, spontaneous, quirky, funny or endearing moments of human interaction and behaviour. The bottom line however, is the photo must look real and believable and not appear staged or posed.</p>\r\n<p>Lifestyle imagery is capturing the essence of what the majority of the consumer market aspires to - people of all ages, genders and races enjoying positive life experiences and people interacting in a myriad of everyday situations with a very upbeat, energetic, optimistic, fun, light-hearted or romantic feel. It shows consumers the ideal of how they would like to live or what they would like to experience - it is essentially idealistic and optimistic.</p>\r\n<p>This image below of two female friends enjoying a gelato on a hot summer\'s day by a popular fountain in the centre of Rome, depicts a very playful, upbeat mood. These models were friends in real life and had a naturally playful and happy interaction between them, which is expressed in this image. The lighthearted mood of this image is also reflected in the choice of colours in the wardrobe, the props and the choice of location and backdrop. Lighting is backlight with the use of a reflector bouncing light back onto the models faces. Movement and expression enhance the playfulness of the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>The challenge in this shoot was to grab a few spontaneous images as quickly as possible given that gelato does not have much sustainability on a hot, summer\'s day and while the models still maintained their enthusiasm for a cold, juicy gelato.</p>\r\n<p>Lifestyle images are often quite generic and not too specific with basic concepts and content that an art buyer can illustrate a wide variety of usages or narratives.</p>\r\n<p>This image below of a woman in a large straw hat on a bright, sunny day with a curious expression could be illustrated for a variety of usages. The obvious would be for beauty, skin care or sun protection, but could also be illustrated for general health and wellbeing.&nbsp; It was shot early in the morning on a terrace with light, reflective tiles, similar to the light reflected from sand at a beach. A large white sheet was places behind the model with the sun backlighting the sheet to burn out the background.&nbsp; In this shoot, shot in the middle of the city, improvisation was used to emulate the lighting and feel of that on a bright, sunny day at the beach.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Classic lifestyle images are of attractive, healthy looking people enjoying an opulent life experience, such as in a luxury hotel or spa on vacation in an exotic location. It also however, encompasses people of all ages and ethnicities, in everyday situations, from drinking a glass of milk at breakfast, catching a bus to work, reading a book or newspaper, doing homework or chilling out while listening to an Ipod at the beach.</p>\r\n<p>In the next photo (below), the model is enjoying an espresso in a quaint caf&eacute; in a historic piazza in the middle of Rome.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>This model was a regular at this particular caf&eacute; and therefore quite relaxed and comfortable in this setting. This made for ideal conditions to capture her happy expression and mood while interacting with friends at the caf&eacute;.</p>\r\n<p>The lighting for this shoot was assisted with artificial light, whereas the previous two photo examples above had sufficient natural ambient and reflective light. A remote flash was used to bounce light on a large white canopy above the tables to balance the light on the model, with that of the light in the background in the piazza and fountain.</p>\r\n<p>A relatively narrow depth of field of f4.5 was used to render the immediate foreground and the fountain in the background out of focus. The model was positioned so that the fountain and piazza behind were visible. The frame is filled with details that tell the story of the location, the caf&eacute; and the atmosphere. Styling was light and bright, avoiding overpowering darker tones to give an overall bright feel to the photo. The white shirt draws immediate attention to the model, which stands out from the subtle grey hues in the picture.</p>\r\n<p>In Lifestye photography the lighting is very natural and ambient, natural diffused window lighting or soft subtle outdoor lighting with the use of reflectors or diffused flash, for fill light to bounce light and give a luminous quality to the light.&nbsp; The light must look natural for the photo to be believable, therefore it is also important not to have the image overlit with artificial lighting, which gives a very unatural feel to the image.</p>\r\n<p>This next photograph was made for a 5-star luxury hotel on the Amalfi Coast in Italy to promote their day spa. The lighting was from natural window lighting, overexposing a few stops to give a luminous high key effect. This also eliminated distracting background information to ensure the focus in this image is on the woman and her treatment. A reflector was used to bounce light back onto the models face and expression. Soft, diffused light, delicately illuminates the theraputic stones and the form of the womans back, while a low tilted angle and narrow depth of field focuses attention on the woman\'s expression.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Without a doubt the single most important component of great lifestyle photographs is choosing your subjects well. Casting people that are naturally expressive, comfortable in their own bodies and more importantly, at ease in front of the camera and enjoy being in front of the camera, will give you that natural quality and spontaneity in your images.</p>\r\n<p>The expression and mood can not be forced, posed or false - it must be felt by the models in order for this to be expressed in the photo. If it feels good for the models it will simultaneously have a good feel in the photo.</p>\r\n<p>If you are to shoot a couple in a romantic scenario, choose a couple that have natural chemistry and spark when they interact. Similarly if you have to shoot a woman in a tranquil yoga pose, cast your subject accordingly, a woman that is familiar with yoga and meditation.</p>\r\n<p>Any situation or interaction that is not &lsquo;felt\' by your model will show up very subtly in the image, in the body language or the expression. It is the little subtleties that speak so powerfully, that can truly make or break a great lifestyle photo.</p>\r\n<p>In this image below, there is obviously a beautiful feeling between this newlywed couple. This image was taken in a park in Florence several hours into the photo shoot, where the couple had become more relaxed and at ease in front of the camera. The use of a long 200mm lens gave me considerable distance from the couple and therefore less awareness of the camera, which allowed for more intimacy between the couple. This was the perfect opportunity to capture the romance, love and chemistry between this couple on their wedding day.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>In comparison to the very first photo example of this week\'s lesson, where I used a shorter focal length lens of 85mm at 3 meters distance from the models to capture the interaction between two friends, here I used a 200mm lens at a distance of 15 meters.&nbsp; The greater distance allowed for more intimate expression between the couple, with far less awareness of the camera and the photographer.</p>\r\n<p>Children are a perfect starting point as they offer endless opportunity of non self conscious moments of spontaneity, playfulness and expression. Select your environment, lighting and composition and allow the scene to unfold spontaneously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this final photo below, the two children were siblings so they were at ease with each other and in a familiar setting at their local day care centre playground. The dappled late afternoon lighting, which was warm and soft, reflects the mood of the toddlers peering out of the box in which they were playing. The composition was simple and graphic and the focus was on the expression on the faces of the two children.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-28 15:34:52','2015-03-28 15:43:43'),(173,56,'Concepts and Coordination: Planning Your Shoot',NULL,'<p>In lifestyle photography, the coordination and preparation of your shoot - from the conceptualisation right down to the finest details - is critical in achieving great lifestyle images.</p>\r\n<p>Everything from scouting the right locations, checking lighting conditions at different times of the day, choosing the clothing and props in consistency with your storytelling and of course casting your models appropriately, is all critcal to the outcome of your photo shoot.

The couple were coordinated in checkered clothing to give a \"country / relaxed\" feel to the photo. The classic, white, vintage Fiat 500 was paramount in creating the romantic and jovial mood to this image.</p>\r\n<p>The photo was shot mid-morning on a slightly overcast day. Placing the sun behind the subjects, I filled in the subjects with very subtle fill-flash with a soft-box placed to my left side.</p>\r\n<p>A relatively narrow depth of field was used to focus in on the subjects and render the background out of focus.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>In the example above, I selected a couple that were naturally very affectionate and loving with each other and also very comfortable in front of the camera. I shot this using a stepladder to achieve the high perspective to create a more graphic shot with a focal length of 85mm shot at F5.6. The wardrobe was kept simple and casual but also contrasting against the green grass. The lighting was soft, warm, late-afternoon light, filtered by sparse trees and filled with a golden reflector to bounce warm light back onto their faces. I like the positioning of the models in this photo, which is very loving and affectionate and also very spontaneous.</p>\r\n<p>In the example that follows of a woman walking down a cobbled stoned street in the centre of Rome, I coordinated the clothing, in keeping with the pastel hues of the surrounding buildings in this urban landscape. The photo was caputred at a moment when the model was laughing at the attention from various onlookers.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>The street was chosen for the colours and the characteristic cobblestone streets typical in the centre of Rome.&nbsp; The model enjoyed being photographed, so it was very easy to capture her being expressive and happy. This was shot with a 200mm lens to flatten the perspective and condense the street scene. I focused in on the model with a narrow depth of field of f 3.5. I chose this street early in the morning for the soft lighting to complement the soft hues and to avoid dark contrast from shadows. At other times of the day, this street was far too heavy with traffic and would not have been possible.</p>\r\n<p>At certain times of the year and during certain seasons, Mother Nature lends a helping hand by creating magnificent displays and masterpieces that create unique outdoor studio opportunities and countless inspirational possibilites. Ideal settings for creating and styling your great lifestyle images. Spring, in particular, is a wonderful season not only for the abundance of colour that abounds, but also for the beautiful soft light, so ideal for lifestyle shoots.</p>\r\n<p>In the next picture, I photographed this young girl playing under this tree, heavily laden with pink blossoms that had also created a beautiful pink carpet beneath the tree. There was a time window of a few days to take this shot, prior to the tree shedding all of its blossoms. This was shot in late afternoon light, filling the image with illumination, directly from the setting sun, to enrich the vibrant colours. A blue dress was chosen again for contrast against the dominance of the pink in this image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Keeping your eyes open and in tune with your surroundings, locations, seasons and light can prove very worthwhile and advantageous in the planning and preparation of your lifestyle shoot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>This image above was styled with a stunning 1920\'s gold vintage dress, that I picked up for a song, in a tiny antique shop. I cast the model for her height and stature to complement the beautiful lines and form of the dress. This was styled also with the black gloves for contrast and to add a feeling of glamour to this image.</p>\r\n<p>The photo was shot in an open landscape near a lighthouse in Australia on a slightly overcast day. The sea breeze was an added bonus in placing a flow of movement to the dress and hair, while the model was striding along the pathway. This photo was from a series that I shot in both colour and black and white film, using an 85mm lens and wide open aperture of f2.8.</p>\r\n<p>In the next photograph below, the location - the \"Caf&eacute; Gilli,\" a well known historic caf&eacute; in the centre of Florence, was chosen for its charming atmosphere and decor - an ideal setting for a romantic wedding shoot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>In Italy not all, but most places are \"photographer friendly,\" meaning that it is possible to utilise great locations for photo shoots, without huge location fees. In this particular case, I obtained permission from the management, prior to shooting.&nbsp; It is always advisable to follow through and supply images for management use, in order to be welcome back the next time. It also sets a good example and will make it easier for fellow photographers, who may also require permission for a shoot, after you have been and gone.</p>\r\n<p>I chose a table by a large open window, which lit the table with soft ambient light falling through large white umbrellas, situated just outside the window. No additional lighting was required for this effect, as I wanted to keep it quite natural with minimal light in the background. A wide-angle lens was used to fill the frame with the beautiful lamps, ceiling and Venetian glass details in the background.

Photos that speak, that move, uplift and inspire.&nbsp; That\'s what it\'s all about.&nbsp; When these feelings are expressed in your photos and felt by the viewer, they will go a long way in selling the product, brand or subject.&nbsp; Such photos communicate the energy so vital for commercial sales and this is exactly what you are aiming to deliver as a lifestyle photographer.</p>\r\n<p>For example, if you see a photo in an editorial or an advertisement of a couple sharing a romantic moment, swinging in a hammock on a sun-drenched beach, you want to be able to feel the warmth of the sun in the photo, smell the sea air and feel the romance of being with the one you love.

In keeping with the light and bright nature of this photo, the darker hues in the shadow details of the street were intentionally cropped from the image.</p>\r\n<p>In the next photograph below of two women on a shopping venture, peering into a shop window at a highly desirable, expensive and fashionable handbag, the mood of joy, excitement and enthusiasm is enhanced by the bright colours of the subject matter.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>This image could be portrayed in many diverse contexts, as it narrates a story of young women, fashion, consumerism, money, friendship, youth culture and beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cropping tight on the subject and expressions instills more impact and gives the image a generic quality. A wider frame could have been chosen also in this case, filling the frame with details of the shop and the products, but would have lessened the impact and message.&nbsp; To make the picture, a focal length of 85mm was chosen, shot at f4.5 at a distance of 2.5 meters.</p>\r\n<p>Shot on a yacht near a beautiful tropical island off the coast of Australia, the next photo below portrays a young couple enjoying the freedom and exhilaration of their environment - its openness and the freshness of the landscape. One can almost smell the sea breeze and warmth of the sun, which is accentuated with the wind in the models hair and light spilling onto the white sail.&nbsp; This image exudes a quality of adventure and freedom of sailing on the sea.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Dynamic composition in this photo was created by placing the subjects in the bottom corner of the image and enhancing the feeling of openness and expansion, by filling the frame with crystal clear blue skies and the white sail. This style of composition is also very useful in an editorial layout context as it has ample negative space to allow for text and typography to be laid in.&nbsp; The image was shot with a wide-angle 35mm lens on medium format colour transparency film.&nbsp; Additionally, a great depth of field was applied and the scene was flooded with light from the early morning sun and bounced back onto the subjects from the white sail and white deck.&nbsp; As in this photo example, casting models appropriately and those that express easily feelings of happiness, joy or pleasure will bring your photos to life.</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the final photograph below, the aim here was to capture this young woman thoroughly savouring her bowl of fresh strawberries and cream.&nbsp; Set in an outdoor café with bright ambient light, the photo was cropped tight to focus attention on the woman\'s expression and on the food.&nbsp; This model was selected for this lifestyle shoot because of her expressive face, ease in front of the camera and her love of strawberries and cream!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-28 15:36:20','2015-03-28 15:48:15'),(175,56,'LIFE & STYLE: Getting the Most From Your Picture',NULL,'<p>Working with the unique environment in which you live combined with a little imagination, creativity, originality and innovation is the foundation for creating dynamic, entertaining and marketable lifestyle photographs.</p>\r\n<p>Your environment, be it, natural or man-made, is your unique canvas.

Italy is blessed with magnificent scenery, both natural and man-made - coupled with beautiful European light, it is the ideal canvas for creating beautiful lifestyle imagery.</p>\r\n<p>The &lsquo;canvas\' for lifestyle photographs in Italy is exceptionally beautiful, rich and romantic with exquisite architectural details that provide the perfect setting for romantic lifestyle photographs. It is for that reason Italy is a popular destination for wedding photography.</p>\r\n<p>In Photo # 1 below, shot in a renaissance villa in Tuscany, the warm tones and graphic form of this architectural detail was chosen for this romantically playful photo of a couple kissing in a doorway. The couple were perfect subjects as they were very comfortable in front of the camera and also had a great chemistry between them, which added an extra spark to their photos.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Shot in the spring with soft natural light, I chose a long focal length to give distance from the subjects in order to allow a more intimate and playful moment to be expressed between them.</p>\r\n<p><br />Even rainy days can prove the perfect setting and environment for vibrant lifestyle photographs.</p>\r\n<p>In the second image that follows of two girls singing in the rain, I was very fortunate to have cast 2 girls that we not only great friends but both had a happy energy and enthusiasm - even in the rain! Styled in bright contrasting colours, the girls were literally singing and skipping in the rain.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>In the preparation, co-ordination of this shoot, I had planned to photograph these girls in the playground in their local park.</p>\r\n<p>This shot was taken at the end of the shoot on the journey back home. The rain started to pour down and it proved the perfect opportunity to capture this spontaneous moment between the girls as they were skipping and singing in the rain, totally unaware of the camera.</p>\r\n<p>When working with children it is essential that they are enthusiastic and eager to take part in the photo shoot - this can sometimes be a little unpredictable with children, so it is important to give yourself a wide scope of opportunity and not be too rigid in your ideas, concepts and planning and allow the shoot to flow more spontaneously.</p>\r\n<p>This was shot on a 200mm lens at f5.6 and 500/ second shutter speed to freeze the motion.</p>\r\n<p>In the next photo example, this beautiful setting in a 16th century villa on Lake Como in Italy, seemed more like a renaissance painting than real life, when I shot this scene in the soft spring light, so ideal in northern Italy.

My goal is to teach you how to capture the best possible photos so you can remember that special place and share it with others forever. The landscape may change, as it is rapidly doing all over the globe, but your moment in time will remain.</p>\r\n<p>Say you don\'t live within driving distance of a national park, wilderness area or open space. That\'s ok, landscape photography is traditionally the capture of a remote place with no sign of human encroachment. I\'m not abiding by that definition. For this course, we will revise the definition of landscape photography to include your local botanical garden, city park, beach, hiking trail, stream, creek or marshland. Any of these locations will be a good start for your adventure into the great outdoors. Perhaps they will inspire you to take your new skills on a big trip to your dream location.</p>\r\n<p>There are a few things I feel compelled to mention about being in the wilderness. Please have respect for nature and animals. The way I look at it, I am a guest in their living room. This is their home, and I must act responsibly as a guest. If I am in a friend\'s home, I make the bed, take out the trash, tidy the bathroom, and wash the dishes. When in the wilderness, I do pretty much the same thing. After all, if I don\'t, it will stay there. I doubt a bear or wolf will come along driving the trash truck to clean up after me. And remember, you are one of many. If everyone trekking the wilderness left trash at the campsite, it wouldn\'t be very photogenic.</p>\r\n<p>Dress appropriately. Check the weather reports for a general idea of what to expect, but even if nice skies are predicted, be prepared for inclement weather. I always keep a change of clothes in the back of my car for the different seasons. While hiking, I roll up a jacket with a hood and some gloves and tie it to my gear bag just in case. For protection, take sunscreen with mosquito repellent in it, and a soft brimmed hat to cut the sun\'s glare in your eyes. Speaking of eyes, check out my tip regarding polarizers and sunglasses on The Compelling Image\'s <a href=\"http://thecompellingimage.wordpress.com/2009/05/07/finding-the-angle-of-polarizers\">blog</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Be safe. This sounds obvious, but is something most people neglect. Wear proper hiking boots for your trek, so you don\'t break an ankle. Research the animals living in the area, and find out what to do if you come across one. Tell someone where you are going and when you plan to return in case the unexpected happens. In all my years of hiking and photographing, the worst thing that has happened to me are two close encounters with rattlesnakes. While you may be scouting for the big animals, don\'t forget the smaller ones on the ground.</p>\r\n<p>Landscape photography necessitates the knowledge of camera settings and accessories. You will not get images like the ones you see in magazines if your camera is set on Auto. Auto is like robot mode. When you leave your camera on Auto, you are basically saying \"hey, camera, use your best guess. I don\'t really need to have any creative input\". That would be like asking a stranger to go grocery shopping for you. They don\'t know what you like and what you don\'t. You\'ll have to eat what they bring back regardless. So why would you ask a robot to be capable of capturing your artistic expression?</p>\r\n<p>Your camera comes pre-programmed with standard settings. Some of these will have to be changed for optimum results. I am not capable of memorizing the inner workings of every camera manufactured, so I will give you a list of settings, and you must use your owner\'s manual to find out how to change them. Please keep in mind the terminology I am using is for Canon cameras. The terms may be slightly different for other brands.</p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>Color Space</strong>. Most cameras have a choice between Adobe RGB and sRGB. Professional shooters always use Adobe RGB because it captures more of the color spectrum than sRGB. sRGB is used for web shots or very small photos where the whole spectrum isn\'t needed.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>File Quality</strong>. You will have a choice of various levels of jpg or RAW. I always shoot in RAW because you have a more complete original file than a jpg which compresses and loses some quality. RAW files are much larger, and use more card space, but that is logical when you are capturing more rather than less data in your images. When you work on your files in PhotoShop, you can do so without destroying the original \"negative\" in a RAW file. There are many Photoshop applications we will use that destroy information stored in jpg files and leave you with a file that cannot stand up to printing the way a RAW file can.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>Noise Reduction</strong>. This tool will automatically detect noise in your photo and correct it in processing. Keep in mind, it cannot correct all noise. If your shot has too much, it won\'t work miracles. That said, set your noise reduction function to On or Auto. I leave mine in the On position. Why? because it is something I don\'t remember to look at every time I go out to shoot. I like to be better safe than sorry. Nothing more frustrating than a beautiful scene you believe you captured, only to get home to find you have to trash the photo due to irreparable noise. Keep in mind the noise reduction tool takes more time to process in the camera because the camera is performing two separate functions - one of writing the information to the sensor, and the other of reducing the noise. If you switch to another type of photography that dictates you capture the images very quickly, like sports, turn it off.</p>\r\n<p>4. <strong>Diopter</strong>. Such a simple tool most people never use. Most of the time, my camera is set to Auto Focus, but there are certain circumstances where Manual Focus works better. If your diopter is not set to your vision, and you manually focus your lens, your images can be blurry. Your camera\'s manual will show you how to set it. Once you do, check it frequently because depending on where it is located on your camera, it can easily be knocked out of place.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>Drive mode</strong>. Single shot is used most frequently for landscapes.</p>\r\n<p>6. <strong>Metering</strong>. Evaluative (Multi) is most common. If you have a backlit situation, you will need to change it, but we will cover that later if necessary.</p>\r\n<p>7. <strong>Program mode</strong>. This depends on what you are shooting. Personally, I capture almost everything in Manual program mode because it allows for the most creative freedom. There will be times you may want to use Aperture or Shutter modes. Aperture controls Depth of Field, and Shutter controls speed. If you need a more thorough explanation of how shutter speeds and apertures work together, download the handout that goes with this lesson.</p>\r\n<p>8. <strong>White Balance</strong>. For now, leave it on Auto. We will do an exercise with the various choices you have. White balance is the way the camera reads light and color and tries to record it as accurately as possible.</p>\r\n<p>9. <strong>ISO</strong>. This is your film speed - the lower the number, the clearer your shot. The catch? You need quite a lot of light to use the lowest numbers. What happens when you are in a low light situation? You need to change your ISO to a higher number, sacrificing more noise (grain). We will cover this in more depth later. For now, set the ISO to 100 or 200. This assumes you are going to be shooting in daylight.</p>\r\n<p>The last thing to remember when shooting landscapes is to use your tripod and hot shoe level. You want to make sure your horizon lines are straight. Otherwise, you will be throwing the photo away, or spending too much time trying to fix it in Photoshop. A shutter release is necessary for longer shutter speeds, so don\'t forget to bring it with you. The optional Hoodman Loupe is also a great tool for outdoor photography. I never leave the house without mine. See the informational blog I wrote about it on The Compelling Image\'s <a href=\"http://thecompellingimage.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/lcd-screens-and-that-glaring-sun\">blog page</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I will walk you through my examples to give you an idea of why I chose to photograph each particular image, the tools I used, and how I composed them. Once you understand, try your hand at the assignment.</p>\r\n<p>The first photograph below was made in Joshua Tree National Park, California in the U.S.A. I live close enough to this park to visit often, so I have become familiar with it. Joshua Tree is in the desert. To be exact, The Colorado Desert, Mojave Desert, and the little San Bernardino Mountains all meet here. This is Barker Dam. California has been suffering from a 10 year drought. It is unusual to have more than a marshy, smelly gunk covering the ground. When I saw a decent amount of water on this day, I had to capture it. The clear blue sky played off the orange/red tint of the rocks making a dynamic colorful statement. The reflections were pure. After checking the view around the dam as far as possible, I chose a strip of sand to set up my gear. This view included the best of the elements I was attracted to - crumbling rocks, the water, the sky, and some beach. I also like the fact that the dead bushes contrasted with the life giving water.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Next, I had to decide what equipment to use for the best results. The first consideration was lens choice. A wide angle would be perfect to take in as much of the scene as I thought appropriate. I knew my circular polarizer would work well because the angle of the sun was at 90 degrees, providing maximum effect. Notice how deep the blue of the sky is. In addition, polarizers cut glare on the lake surface. This shot would not be as successful without the deep blue sky, or if you could not see reflections due to glare. I set my camera on a tripod and used the level that fits in my hotshoe. This assured a straight horizon line. Take a moment to set up properly so you don\'t have to throw the image away due to a crooked horizon line. Can\'t I fix that in Photoshop, you ask? Well, yes, to a degree. You must sacrifice sections of your image when you crop and straighten. That could ruin you image, too. Cutting too much off your carefully composed scene may cause you to lose important compositional elements that make it work in the first place. Then I decided to use an aperture of f11 to provide sharp detail from front to back. An ISO of 50 made sure there was no noise (grain).</p>\r\n<p>In summary, why did I spend the time to take this shot? First, the water in the dam made it a scene you can\'t see very often. I was capturing something unusual. Second, the lighting conditions were perfect for the photographic tools I had.</p>\r\n<p>The second photo (below) shows that you do not need to travel to an exotic, far off location to achieve nice shots. This was taken in a small strip of wild land between housing developments in an urban area of Southern California. This day, I decided to take an exploratory hike, not really expecting to find anything special. I was wrong. Normally, these hills are brown, dry, and pretty boring. But the February rains brought wild mustard plants out in abundance. As in first photograph in this lesson (above), the contrast of colors made a bold statement. Another element that caught my eye was the gentle diagonal lines in the hills. The top edge of land slopes upward, and the middle ground does so even more drastically. The faint hiking trail you see towards the bottom creates a \"smile\" that leads your eye back up into the photo again. This type of composition is always strong. Another piece of the compositional puzzle that makes this simple landscape work is the patch of bare land. If the entire foreground were solid yellow, it wouldn\'t have been as interesting. It also documents the fragility of the land in this earthquake prone zone.&nbsp; My equipment was the very same as in the previous picture - Tripod, level, wide angle lens, and circular polarizer. Aperture of f11, ISO at 50.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next picture is of a river that runs to Moose Falls in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, U.S.A. I love this location, but unfortunately, the day of my visit was drab and gray. I wanted to document the icy water so decided to take the shot with the intention of converting it into black and white using PhotoShop. The compositional elements were apparent. The contrast of a man made stone bridge with the natural trees and river pleases the eye. The leading line of brush in the center of the river draws your eye to the bridge and the curve of the bend allows you to travel with it under the bridge and into the distance. I purposely left only a small amount of sky in the frame because its color was wintery white, and did nothing to enhance the overall feeling of the photo. Keep that in mind when you are composing your shots. If there is too much dead space that serves no purpose, recompose. We will go over how to convert a color photo to black and white in our last lesson. As you are shooting your assignments, photograph some landscapes with the intention of a black and white conversion for later on.&nbsp; My tools were a tripod, shutter release (because the lighting was dim, and a slow shutter speed was necessary) level, and wide angle lens, set at aperture f22 and ISO at 50.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Madeline Island is located in Lake Superior, in the U.S. state of Wisconsin and this is the site of the following image. This particular evening\'s sunset had spectacular colors. The clouds completed the composition. I got permission for myself and my workshop students to photography from a privately-owned dock. It positioned us out into the lake providing a view that was not possible from land. Composition is key in this simple shot. Notice that the horizon line is not in the middle. It is placed at the bottom third. If it were smack-dab in the center, it would be quite boring. Equal emphasis on fore and background is normally not very exciting. When composing your shots, decide where you want to draw your viewer\'s eye, and place the emphasis there. Another element of this composition that helps guide you eye are the leading lines of the dock. They start in the lower left, cutting diagonally toward the center, break, then pick up again a bit before turning, forming a parallel line with the horizon. You eyes can travel from bottom to top to middle. If the clouds were not here this evening, your eye would not move further than the horizon line.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Timing was critical, too. I fired off several shots before the sun was completely down, but they contained too much glare and highlight blowouts. Waiting until the sun dipped below the land made the colors very intense and eliminated the glare and blowouts.&nbsp; I used my tripod, shutter release, level, wide angle lens. Aperture set to f8 and ISO of 50.</p>\r\n<p>The final photograph of this lesson was taken at Schwabacher Landing in the Grand Tetons, Wyoming (U.S.A). The winter had been particularly wet and snowy, so this river was overflowing its banks. I had never seen the rivers and lakes in the Grand Tetons so full before. The wild grasses were shades of vivid greens, yellows and oranges. My students and I gasped in awe of such a beautiful site. When you gasp, you know you must capture the moment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Notice this is a vertical composition. Most beginning students always shoot horizontally. When you are composing you photos, try looking through your viewfinder at the scene vertically, as well. You may find that it suits your image much better than framing it horizontally. This scene was perfect for a vertical shot. The river diagonally leads your eye up into the center of the photo, then the tree line cuts across the composition horizontally, the tops pointing up to the mountains and sky. I used my tripod, level, shutter release (even though it was bright, and a fast shutter speed, the tripod was set on lose rocks, and shaky) wide angle lens, and polarizer. My lens aperture was set at f22 and ISO at 50.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you have some idea of what to do with your camera, get out there and put it to work. Keep these thoughts in mind. Try to find something unusual about the scene, something that makes it special from any other day. Think about how much of the image you want in focus. Use an aperture that will best convey it. Don\'t forget about your polarizer. It can make the difference between an average shot and a great one by enhancing colors and eliminating glare. Use your shutter release if your shutter speed is slow, or your tripod is on shaky ground. You don\'t want to waste a good shot by knocking the camera accidentally. Have fun with your assignment. Don\'t expect perfection. You learn more from your mistakes than from your successes.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-30 08:21:08','2015-03-30 08:21:08'),(177,57,'Timing - Right Place, Right Moment',NULL,'<p>What makes the difference between a snapshot of a landscape you see on the desk of a coworker and one that appears on the cover of a photography magazine? Equipment? Well, somewhat, but I\'ve seen wonderful photos taken with non-professional cameras. Experience? Yes, no doubt experience plays into achieving a great shot, but you can still get good photos even if you are just starting out. The key is to place yourself in the right place at the right time.</p>\r\n<p>If you want to become a good landscape photographer, there are a few personality traits you must hone. First, patience is essential. You must be willing to travel to your intended location and wait for the perfect moment to capture an image worthy of displaying. You should be willing to go back again and again in different seasons to find perfect opportunities each one provides. Many times you will travel a significant distance only to find the conditions are not what you expected.</p>\r\n<p>This brings me to the second personality trait advantageous for a landscape photographer. Adaptability. As much as we can control our indoor environments with air conditioning and heating, the great outdoors is a different story. You must be able to adapt to the conditions presented to you. There are certain steps you can take to predict the best time to visit your chosen location. Weather reports from the area, a phone call to the closest Ranger Station for on-the-spot information, checking the average temperature and snow/rainfall on a yearly basis are all helpful. I find www.weather.com a good resource. Even using these tools, the weather has a mind of its own, and you are still at its mercy. What happens when it is not what you expected? Over the years, I have adopted a credo for outdoor photography, as well as life in general. \"Adapt or die\". We cannot control everything outside of ourselves, so we must be able to adjust our circumstances and attitudes to get by. In landscape photography, you must be able to see the opportunities in front of you instead of what you guessed they would be.</p>\r\n<p>The third personality trait is perseverance. Just as if you were training for running a marathon or performing a piano recital, you must keep practicing photography. Do not get discouraged if you don\'t get the perfect shot the first time you visit your location. Professional photographers don\'t get the shot the first time either. Sometimes, the shot is technically perfect, but boring. Maybe it needs a bird in the background, some mist instead of sun, the flowers to be in bloom. You may need to change your camera settings or lens to achieve more of a statement about the mood of the landscape. Keep trying and experimenting. You will get the shot at some point.</p>\r\n<p>The personality traits listed above are what will get you to the right place at the right time. They will give you the desire to wake up before dawn to travel to your destination before the sun crests the horizon. To be a little uncomfortable in extreme weather to get the perfect shot. To lovingly prepare your equipment-charge batteries, clean lenses, format memory cards-so you are ready to roll on a moments notice.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s talk about the right place. I would describe it as one of visual emotion. Whether that emotion comes in the form of peacefulness, excitement, appreciation, or even agitation, it is creating a feeling inside you. When you see a landscape that evokes an emotion, it is worthy of documenting. Maybe its a lonely highway in the middle of nowhere. Perhaps a beach with waves carving out dramatic cliffs. If you see a place that makes you stop and say \"wow\", photograph it. It\'s always a bonus if it is somewhere that hasn\'t been photographed before. Some of the most beautiful spots on earth have been shot so many times, we take them for granted. If you really want to get a photo of a place that has been overly photographed, try to incorporate something into the scene that makes it different from anyone else\'s image, or use a lens or aperture setting that you wouldn\'t normally think of trying.</p>\r\n<p>Timing. It is critical for so many things in life, and landscape photography is no different. Sometimes the most beautiful shots happen just before, during, or after a storm. Cloud formations create dramatic skies, the lighting becomes more interesting, and you can find a very special landscape in front of you. Keep track of events that happen in the location you want to shoot. Is there a bird migration at a certain time of the year? Is the full moon out? Is there a festival planned? When is the most reliable time of year for storms? When do wildflowers appear? When are the mountains dusted with snow? Knowing the events that happen in your locations will aid you in taking better images. When I plan my in-the-field workshops, I take all of this into consideration and choose the dates accordingly. You should do the same. You only have a few days to complete your assignment, and may not be lucky enough to experience special weather circumstances. If this is the case, I urge you to take your photographs when the lighting creates a mood at your location. Try all times of the day. Early morning provides soft light. If the sun is shining, midday has a flat, cardboard cut-out look to it . Late afternoon/early evening casts long shadows. Sunset has colorful skies. Overcast days make everything evenly lit. We will spend more time on lighting in the next lesson, so don\'t expect to be perfect right now. Just observe the light to see what kind of mood it makes, and capture it.</p>\r\n<p>In your previous assignment, you explored how apertures and shutter speeds work together. Here, we will discuss the creative aspects of apertures. I consider aperture the story telling tool of landscape photography. I always choose my aperture before anything else. How much of the scene do I want in sharp focus? Is there anything in the foreground or background that is distracting? How much distance is there between important objects? If I want the scene sharp from front to back, I will use an aperture of f11 or more. The smaller the opening, (the larger the f number) the more focal length you have, giving more depth of field. If I need to give less emphasis to a distracting object in the for or background, I will open up the aperture (using a small f number) to blur the offensive object, but keep my subject in focus. The range of f5 or less, depending on lens and distance, does the trick. Ask yourself: \"What is the story here?\" Chose an aperture that best tells your story. Refer to your download on apertures and shutter speeds, and check your aperture comparison experiments in your last lesson to help you make decisions.</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s look at some examples.</p>\r\n<p>The first photograph was made at Oxbow Bend in Grand Teton National Park in the U.S. western state of Wyoming. My students and I arrived as a storm was passing over the mountains. This photo was captured at 8:16 a.m. on a summer morning. At some point, you will hear photographers say that the only times worth shooting are at dawn and dusk. While images from these times of day are beautiful, you can get striking photos at any time of day. Look for elements of color, composition, and texture. If they are present, you have good subjects no matter the time of day. My tools were a telephoto lens, tripod, polarizer, shutter release, level. ISO at 50, f11 @ 1/8 sec.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>The next photo shows what you can get when you wait for the sun to dip well behind the horizon line. Many beginning photographers leave the scene as soon as they cannot see the sun anymore. This is a mistake. The colors get even more intense as the sun moves further down. Twilight can be the most exciting time to photograph because of this. I photographed a musician for an album cover. We went to a remote place in the mountains that has a view of the city below. A storm started to blow in just as the light became perfect for the shot I had in mind. I just love it when Mother Nature adds a bonus to the shot. This photo makes the most of the deep blue color twilight and the contrast orange in the storm clouds. Tools: wide angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level. ISO 160, f5.6 @ 6 seconds. 5:15 p.m. in winter.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Idyllwild, California was the site of one of my in-the-field-workshops and where the photo below was made.&nbsp; The previous day\'s storm was breaking, and the clouds were very beautiful. I took the students out to Lake Hemet hoping to capture some colorful boats on the lake, but no such luck. We waited, wandered off to photograph other things, came back throughout the day, but no one was sailing. Although we got some nice shots of wildflowers, trees, and shoreline, a good shot of the lake seemed to elude us. I surveyed the scene many times, but the light, colors and texture didn\'t feel very exciting. Just as we were about to give up and move on, this father and son walked into the frame. \"Adapt or Die\" I thought. I won\'t get the intended boats, but this works just as well. The father\'s blue clothing harmonized well with the colors of the lake and sky, and the boy\'s orange jacket supplied the pop the image needed. The boy\'s hand on his father\'s leg added an element of emotion to the photo. Patience prevailed, and we went home happy.&nbsp; Here I used my wide-angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level, and polarizer. ISO at 50, f11 @ 1/50 sec.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Here I used my wide-angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level, and polarizer. ISO at 50, f11 @ 1/50 sec. The image below is one that shows you don\'t need to be in a national park to get nice shots. These windmills are off a desert highway about 40 miles from my home. I have passed by them for four years, thinking out loud that they had potential, but conditions were never quite right. One day, my home weather station indicated a storm on the way, so I decided to make the drive and see if I could finally get my shot. Dramatic skies as a backdrop to the wildly spinning windmills made me take notice. There are hundreds of windmills evenly spaced in rows across the land. I drove until I found a section that had its own personality. The single still windmill that faces the others seemed to be a Sergeant issuing orders to spin faster. That lent a story to the image.&nbsp; I used my tripod, shutter release, level, and a special filter called a Vari-ND filter to cut down on light. Because it was a bright day, and I wanted to show the spinning of the blades, I needed to slow my shutter down. Even with an small aperture and low ISO, I still could not get a slow enough shutter speed without this filter. Ask me about it if you are interested. ISO at 50, f22 @ 1/5 sec.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>A group of lazy pelicans forms the subject for the next photo here.&nbsp; They know exactly where to find an easy meal. I am currently photographing fine art series on piers and beaches. I had already captured a few good beach shots so I decided to take a stroll on the pier. The pelicans were quite use to people, and seemed content to wait for some cast offs of bait from the local fishermen. I couldn\'t resist setting up my tripod and hope for the right moment. The late afternoon light was perfect, the sky had a few wisps of clouds, and all I had to do was wait for some action from the birds. This photo is also an example of selective focus. I used an aperture of f4 and a Lensbaby lens that allows you to select the part of the image you want in sharp focus, while choosing other areas you want to blur. Using a combination of lens and aperture allowed me to single out the birds. If I would have used a higher aperture, the birds would have gotten lost among the other elements of the photo. Your eye would not know what to rest on if the beach and building were as clear as the pelicans. Twenty minutes later, the pelicans started stretching, prancing, and showing off. I got several animated shots of the comical pair. Again, my trusty tripod, shutter release, and level were put to use. Lensbaby lens (50mm), ISO at 50, f4 @ 1/250 sec.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>This final image is a night exposure of the San Clemente Pier in Southern California from the Piers and Beaches series. I love night photography for the challenges it presents and the results achieved when done well. I have seen night shots done beautifully from wonderful photographers, so I wanted to try something different. Instead of the typical clear, sharply focused image, I decided to go in the other direction and zero in on the tower while blurring the rest of the image. I set up before sunset and waited until the deep colors of twilight took hold. Again, I used the Lensbaby to aid my focusing point and blur around the tower. An aperture of f8 gave me the perfect depth of field. I was please with the way the lights stretched to oblong shapes and the overall dreamy quality of the photo. The usual tripod, shutter release, level were used. Lensbaby lens (50mm), ISO at 800, f8 @ 0.5 sec.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Now it is your turn. Take your assignment and go enjoy the great outdoors. I\'m looking forward to seeing your results.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-30 08:22:30','2015-04-17 12:45:29'),(178,57,'Catch That Light!',NULL,'<p>Light. Without it, there is no photography. In fact the word photography originates from the Greek words phos (light), and graphis (stylus or paintbrush) which when put together mean drawing with light or painting with light. When the definition of your chosen creative field means capturing light, it also means your number one subject matter is light. Ever notice photographs of very ordinary, even ugly objects that are breathtaking? I can guarantee you it is because the photographer captured the subject with extraordinary light. I am thinking of Edward Weston\'s \"Eroded Plank from Barley Sifter, 1931 (see following link: www.artnet.com/.../eroded-plank-from-barley-sifter.html) or Paul Strand\'s \"Lathe No. 3, Akeley Shop, New York 1923 (see following link: faculty.dwc.edu/wellman/Srand-Lathe3.htm. It is your goal to think about light in landscape photography the way these masters thought about it on objects.</p>\r\n<p>There are many different kinds of light that work well for landscape photography. In this lesson we will explore five of them.</p>\r\n<p>Sunrise and sunset are the times most photographers choose to work. Called the Golden Hour, the times just before, during, and after sunrise and sunset bathe the landscape with colors not seen at any other time of the day. Sunrise casts soft pastel shades of pink, lavender, rose, yellow, and blue. Sunset provides the intense reds, yellows, oranges, blues, and purples that we are impressed with. At these hours, the sun is very low on the horizon line, so it accents textures by casting side lighting. You will notice the shapes and surfaces of rocks, mountains, leaves, sand, etc., are very well defined by side lighting. Long, soft shadows add interest to your compositions.</p>\r\n<p>In mid morning to mid afternoon, the sun is high in the sky. Shadows can be very black and clouds very white. The contrast is intense, and is difficult for your camera to handle even with filters. This kind of light can still work for you if you have the right subject matter. For instance, water needs overhead light to show its brilliant color. If you have a lake or ocean near you, observe its color at different times of the day. You will find it is most vibrant when the sun is high. Using a shadow as a compositional element can work too. A simple subject such as a palm tree can become spectacular when you incorporate the shadow into the frame.</p>\r\n<p>Overcast lighting, when the sun is obscured by a thick layer of clouds allows for saturation of colors and low contrast in your photos. Don\'t make the mistake of thinking you need a brilliant blue sky to have a successful photograph. When the light is subdued, you don\'t have shadows making patterns across the image, competing for attention with your main subject. There are no severe contrasts to make metering difficult. Aside from sunrise and sunset, your nicest images will result from diffused lighting conditions. One tip to keep in mind is that if your sky is white, or has no interest in it whatsoever, crop your image so that there is very little or no sky. In this kind of lighting, the sky is not your subject, the land is.</p>\r\n<p>Fog is another kind of diffused lighting. It is perfect for making a statement with your photos. Automatically mysterious and captivating, fog will help you tell a story with your image. You can elude to a secret, a dangerous path, something or someone about to emerge into the frame. I love shooting in foggy conditions because they create some very beautiful fine art images.</p>\r\n<p>Late afternoon light is wonderful for casting long, soft shadows. They add graphic elements to your composition. The light is still high enough for the shadows, but low enough to have a warm tone to it. It is a color between the white of midday, and the gold of sunset. Side lighting such as this also makes textures more pronounced. Sand, rocks, tree bark, leaves and flower petals reveal their surfaces at this time of day more than at any other.</p>\r\n<p>There is a very useful filter that I suggest getting if you find you really like landscape photography. I did not require it for this course, but an investment in a warming filter is a good idea. Warming filters can do several things. First, they can cut down on the bluish cast that is common in overcast and hazy days. Second, they intensify sunsets. Third, the colors of fall leaves will become more brilliant with a warming filter. If you notice a slight bluish cast in your photos, think about purchasing a warming filter. Can you correct blue cast in PhotoShop? Yes. That\'s another reason I did not require the filter. But if you are like me, I would rather get the shot right in the camera than spend time correcting it afterward.</p>\r\n<p>Part of catching the light is knowing when to use your white balance creatively. You experimented with it in the first assignment, so you should have some comparison examples of how the mood of your shots is affected by color tone. Sometimes, you do not want to use the obvious choice for your white balance setting. If you are going to shoot a vibrant sunset, try using the cloudy setting. This will enhance the warm tones and give the sunset more of an orangish glow. In autumn, I suggest trying the cloudy setting if there is an abundance of fall colored leaves in the composition. Just as in a sunset shot, it will bump up the warm tones and make the leaves sing out.</p>\r\n<p>Lets look at some examples photographed at different times of day and night.</p>\r\n<p>The very first image below was made in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming, USA at Mormon Row with my most recent workshop group. We arrived at the site 1/2 hour before sunrise to set up and wait for the perfect light. I noticed the Bison far off in the distance and as they temperamental animals, kept a close eye on them. We organized our tripods in the dark to get the best angle of the barn and waited. The bison kept moving in. When they got within 100 feet, I had the group move behind a barbwire fence. As if on cue, when the sun crested the mountain and showered the barn with the first golden light of day, the bison walked right across our frame (within 20 feet) and we got our shot. Hollywood could not have created a better set than this. Take a look at the golden tones of this light. See the long shadows and soft color in the sky? This is the kind of light you can expect from sunrises and why its worth waking up early. By the way, I don\'t recommend getting this close to bison. If you approach them, you are intruding in their territory, and they could charge. Since they were moving in our direction, they were watching us for signs of aggression as well. Neither of us showed any, so all was well, but I must still emphasize that they are unpredictable. Tools: wide angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level, warming filter. ISO 50, f4 @ 1/50 sec. 6:11 a.m. in summer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next photo shows what you can get when you wait for the sun to dip well behind the horizon line. Many beginning photographers leave the scene as soon as they cannot see the sun anymore. This is a mistake. The colors get even more intense as the sun moves further down. Twilight can be the most exciting time to photograph because of this. Dana Point Harbor, in Southern California, has a view to the south of its bridge, boats in the harbor, and the hills of San Clemente. This photo makes the most of the deep blue color twilight cast on the scene against the complimentary orangey-yellow glow of the harbor and city lights. Tools: telephoto lens, tripod, shutter release, level. ISO 200, f8 @ 15 seconds. 7:31 p.m. in winter.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Midday sun can really enhance the color of a lake (image below). This photo represents perfectly calm water reflecting the snow dusted mountain behind it. The ice layer around the edges accentuates the cold feel to the winter scene. This image is successful because of the intensity of the lake acting as an echo to the landscape. If it had been shot at any other time of day, the blue of the water would have been washed out, and the reflection not as powerful. Take a look at the right hand side of the picture. See how dark the pine tree and its reflections are? The shadows of midday sun can be almost black. In fact, I had to adjust the shadows in photoshop so they wouldn\'t lose all their detail. Tools: wide angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level, circular polarizer. ISO 100, f7.1 @ 1/80 sec. 11:22 a.m. in winter.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Strawberry Creek is the subject of the next photograph. It starts as snow melt off from the San Jacinto mountains and meanders its way through Idyllwild, California. This day was completely overcast. As you can see, the filtered light enhanced the overall colors and created an even tone with no extreme contrasts. This kind of light is perfect for photographing waterfalls, streams, creeks, and flower fields. If you want enhanced colors with low contrast, go out and shoot under overcast skies. Tools: wide angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level, circular polarizer. ISO 50, f11 @ 1/3 sec. 10:59 a.m. in spring.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the next picture, I was given the perfect opportunity to create a moody scene. The fog rolled in over Lake Fulmor, and it was too obscured to see. Adapt or die! I decided to capture a small section of the walkway. I purposely composed the shot to eliminate the sky because there was no interest there, and it did nothing for the composition. I used a aperture that would force the front of the photo into sharp focus, gently blurring as it disappears into at the background. The fog adds to the mystery of what is beyond the curve of the path, and that provided the story to this photo. Tools: wide angle lens, tripod, shutter release, level, warming filter. ISO 50, f4 @ 1/30 sec. 12:20 p.m. in fall.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Oceanside Pier in Oceanside, California is site of the final photograph presented here. The key ingredient that makes this photo successful is the beautiful golden side lighting caused by the late afternoon angle of the sun. See the long, low shadow of the boy in front? Study the way the light is hitting only one side of his body, leaving the other in darkness. The second element adding to the mood of this image is the grainy quality attributed to the pinhole lens I shot it with. Ask me about it if you want to learn more.

I think he would be absolutely thrilled with the new technology of digital photography and computer software. He stove to get a great shot inside the camera, then perfected it in the darkroom. This is what we do with our digital photographs.</p>\r\n<p>The reason you are taking the time to do these lessons is to become a good photographer. Part of that is learning how to hone your images using computer software. This final lesson will show you how to take an image that is technically good and give it that extra zing we all like in landscape photography. The best way to do it is to show you the steps I take with an example photo to bring up the full potential. There are a multitude of adjustments you can make to an image, but for this beginning course, we will cover the basics.</p>\r\n<p>There are many different computer software programs, just as there are several different camera manufacturers. Some of the best are PhotoShop, Aperture, and Lightroom. I work mainly with PhotoShop. The examples I work with will be explained with PhotoShop techniques. You can use the base knowledge from this and apply it to the software program you have available to you. Keep in mind that if you are using the software that came with your camera, you may be limited as to how much you can do with it. Let me know what software you used when you upload your images, and if your program did not have the capability to make any of the adjustments I suggest. You may need to refer to the help menu of your program to find certain items.</p>\r\n<p>There are several things I look at once I capture the initial image. First, is the composition good enough? If not, can I crop it to make it better? Second, is is sharp enough? If not, is it too soft for my software to fix? Is the exposure good? If not, is it within the perimeters of repairing? Does the overall feel of the photo convey what I intended? If not, can I add to the overall mood with some minor touches in PhotoShop? If the composition, sharpness, and intention are beyond mending, I toss the photo. If they are redeemable, I proceed. One clarification I should mention here is that sharpness is different from focus. If your image is out of focus, software programs have very limited abilities to fix that. If the image is a little soft - or put another way, not sharp enough, your program can fix that assuming it is not severely soft. The main reason an image may not be tack sharp is the quality of your lens. If you are working with consumer grade lenses, you will probably not get shots that are as sharp as if you were using professional lenses. Digital capture and in-camera processing have a slight softening effect, and the degree of softening depends on how good your sensor is. In both of these cases, the price difference between consumer grade lenses and cameras is vast. Fortunately, we have the software to mend this issue.</p>\r\n<p>I have learned to do certain procedures in the particular order listed here. The reason is that if I try to do them out of order, some layers will not let me perform other tasks on top of them. Filters only work on content layers, not on adjustment layers. Follow this order and you will not have problems. Each step we take will be made on a new layer. If you are unfamiliar with how to do that, see Screen Shot - New Layer (below). To rename the new layers, double click on the TEXT only of the new layer to write over it. Naming the layers is important because when you have a lot of them, you want to know which one has which adjustment on it. If you want to see the effect your new adjustment has on the photo, click on the eyeball next to the layer. This turns your layer on and off.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s look at the first photo below of a very calm lake in winter. The surface is so still, it acts as a mirror reflecting the shoreline\'s bare winter limbs on the surface. This shot is straight out of the camera with no editing. After initial assessment, I felt it image was good enough to proceed.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #1</strong>- Does the image need to be cropped? In this case, no. I framed it in the viewfinder exactly the way I wanted it. Fortunately, I was able to position myself to capture the image with nothing distracting in the frame. This isn\'t always possible. Sometimes you cannot (and should not) hang over a cliff or stand in the middle of a rapid river to eliminate the power wires or telephone pole in the way. If this is your case, cropping is the answer. Cropping is also helpful when you want to eliminate a white sky or too much foreground. If you don\'t know where the crop tool is in PhotoShop, look at the Screen Shot - Crop example below. On the left, the crop tool is circled in red.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #2</strong> - With the image at 100%, look at it to see if it is sharp. Don\'t try to assess you image any larger than 100%. It will pixilate after that, and you will not have anaccurate way to judge it. To find where to enlarge your photo to 100%, see Screen Shot - Zoom (below).&nbsp; Look for the red circles in this screen shot, as with all of the following ones. I felt this image could benefit from a little sharpening. Before you sharpen your image, create a new layer from your original photo. I used a 1.2 radius and amount at 56% to remove Gaussian Blur. This amount is going to be different for your photos, and the editing process is where you need to develop your artistic eye for the best final results. You will need to play around with the settings for sharpening, as you will for all the other editing we will do to find the most appropriate effect. Use my suggestions as a guide, but don\'t assume these settings will work for your image. Do not over sharpen. This is one of the most common mistakes of beginning photographers. If you over sharpen, color transitions will become blocks instead of smooth gradations, and any slight noise in your image will become more pronounced. See the next Screen Shot below - Sharpen to find your sharpening tool.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #3</strong> - Assess the exposure. In the case of this example, the exposure straight out of the camera is fine, but I am going to adjust it 1/4 stop so you can see how its done. When you make a new layer for your exposure, you will do it differently than before. See the next Screen Shot - Exposure for details below. Click on the circle that is 1/2 black and 1/2 white, then scroll down to exposure and click to bring up the dialog box. Move the exposure slider until you like the results. Don\'t touch the offset or gamma sliders. You do not need to rename this layer because is already named.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #4</strong> - The icing on the cake is saturation. Our eyes have become accustom to the hyper-saturation of television commercials, print ads, and the touched up color in landscape photography magazines. We expect the colors in the natural landscape to be the same, but nature has to deal with survival, and many times that means the camouflage of a more subdued palette. To bump up the intensity, we can use the saturation tool. See Screen Shot - Saturation to find the controls (below). You must be careful not to overdo saturation. If you push it too far, not only will it become unbelievable, but the image will posterate, and be ruined. In the example presented here, I used the slider to increase saturation to +48. Don\'t touch the hue or lightness sliders. Now that you can see the adjustments I made, compare this first image with that below. This type of improvement is what you are after with your images.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Converting a color image to a black and white one has become easier with the improved software available today. There are several ways to go about this. Each has it\'s own merits and drawbacks. I will show you the one I get the best results with. The next photo was taken at Mammoth Hot Springs, at Yellowstone National Park in the western part of the United States. I love the pattern and texture of the landscape. But the day was overcast, and while most of the time this is good lighting, its not for this subject. The very subtle, almost monotone colors were too similar to be enhanced by the diffused light. We tried to get some shots, but nothing was working. I asked my students to keep shooting with the goal of getting a good exposure and we would work on it in PhotoShop. They didn\'t believe a shot like this was redeemable, but were very pleased when I showed them the black and white technique. As you can see from the RAW example, the shot is truly boring. Follow the next steps and see the magic you can make.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>First, I made a new layer and sharpened the image. Second, I made a Black and White layer. See Screen Shot - B&amp;W Layer. I opened the dialog box and selected \"Custom\" from the Preset options. See Screen Shot - B&amp;W Custom (below). You can see the adjustments I made for this image. Yours will be different. You will need to play with the sliders until you get the result you want. I felt the photo lacked dimension even after this adjustment, so I changed the levels. See Screen Shot - Levels (below). I pulled the arrows on the black side and the white side until they were just touching the edges of the graph. See Screen Shot - Levels Dialog below. This helped a lot, but I still think the imaged needed more zing. To give it that punch, I bumped up the contrast. See Screen Shot - Contrast (below). Moving the Contrast slider and the brightness slider to the right until I was satisfied, I once more assessed the image and was happy with it. Compare Example #3 and Example #4 to see the vast difference. Notice how #3 is flat and dull, and #4 has the punch to make you want to look at it?&nbsp; Now you get to play with your editing software. Go to your assignment and get started.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment14}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-30 08:26:12','2015-03-30 09:27:10'),(180,58,'Finding Your Subject - Possibilities Are Endless',NULL,'<p>Macro Photography reveals an entirely new world. We are use to seeing the whole of our surroundings, not necessarily the fine details. We absorb an entire landscape, the city skyline, or a bouquet of flowers. Macro photography encourages us to break down the whole into segments, and break those segments down even further. My goal is to help you visit the world in more detail, finding beauty in objects others pass by. Once you train your eyes to see in detail, you will have an endless supply of subject matter to choose from, and your macro lens will become your best friend.</p>\r\n<p>You are about to embark on an exploration of the world with fresh eyes. Right now you are sitting in front of your computer reading this lesson. What do you see in the immediate vicinity? Pencils and pens? Coffee cup? Your hands on the keyboard? Any of these items can be inspected at close range and become interesting subjects for a macro photograph. Let\'s explore some more. Look at the change in your wallet or pocket. Coins have texture and color. Throw them onto a table and see how nice they look through a macro lens. Do you have a child? If you have toys around the house, take a fresh look up close. A train, legos, jacks, stuffed animals, or a chess set? Any of these would make a great macro shot.</p>\r\n<p>Go outside. Look at the bark of a tree. Get up really close. You will see colors, patterns and texture that are not obvious from a normal distance. Look at all the natural elements available to you. How about the inside of a flower? There are beautiful colors and patterns in there. A spider\'s web has beautiful patterns, especially visible when backlit. Colorful rocks, blades of grass, cracks in the sidewalk. These are all possibilities.</p>\r\n<p>Still can\'t decide on a subject? GET CLOSER! Walk around with your camera and look at everything from the following distances: 12 inches (31cm), 6 inches (15cm), 3 inches (8cm) and 1inch (3cm). Your lens will determine how close you can get. If you are unable to get within an inch, no worries, just get as close as you possibly can. Macro photography allows you to create a new meaning from a tired object.</p>\r\n<p>There a few basic things to keep in mind. First, the best results come with manual focusing. If your lens has an option between manual and auto focusing, make sure you set it for manual focus. This is important because when you are so close to the subject, if you have your lens set to auto focus, it may very well choose the wrong part of your composition to focus on. If your focus is off just a fraction, it can ruin your photo. You are taking the time to carefully look for subject matter, whether in nature or setting up a still life. Don\'t waste this time by taking a shot in which the most important part of the image is out of focus. Take control of your lens and tell it exactly what you want to do. If your eyes are less than perfect, make sure you set your camera\'s diopter to your eyes. Look in your owner\'s manual for instructions on how to do this.</p>\r\n<p>Use your tripod. A bean bag or gorillapod will work too, but I much prefer tripods because of their adaptability. Use your shutter release or camera&rsquo;s self timer. Set your timer to the least amount of seconds as possible, usually 2 seconds. I use these tools even if I am in bright sunlight with a fast shutter speed. The reason? I may take up to an hour to set up a still life. I want all the elements of it perfectly in place. I don\'t want to take the chance of accidentally bumping my camera or the set up and having all that time wasted. Believe me, it is very easy to accidentally move your subject or your camera when you are working in such close proximity. Just your hand touching the camera can move it a fraction and make the difference between a blurry shot and a clean shot. Keep in mind that when you are outside, the slightest breeze can move your subject and your image will be blurry. Have patience and wait for the wind to subside before releasing your shutter.</p>\r\n<p> Finally, you must choose your aperture. Set your camera in aperture or manual priority, and choose the aperture. Knowing which aperture to choose will become easier with practice. For now, you should experiment with different apertures to see how much it changes your depth of field. A wide open aperture will give you much less depth of field than a smaller one. Remember, the lower the number of your aperture, the more open the lens is, and vice versa. This means an aperture of f4.0 will have everything in front and behind your subject blurred more than an aperture of f11. Lesson 3 is all about aperture and depth of field, so you will learn more detail about this later. Just play around and get a feeling for it. When you start shooting, take the same exact photo in several different apertures so you can compare the effect.</p>\r\n<p>I trust you have found several inspiring subjects for your first assignment, so let\'s start shooting. I\'m going to walk you through my examples so you understand my thought process, techniques, and equipment. A side note: I prefer to shoot in manual mode, because I have total control, but for this assignment, you can shoot just as well in aperture priority.</p>\r\n<p>The first image below is that of a glass marble. I loved the way the bright sunlight went straight through it and enhanced the colors. The shadow was a key part of the composition, anchoring the marble to an otherwise floating surface. I wanted a bright white background to make the black look even blacker, and the colors really pop. The architecture inside the marble was of special interest, so I positioned it at an angle that would show it off. When setting up your still life, take the time to inspect it from every angle. Sometimes the one you think will not work turns out to be the best. This example illustrates how a very simple object can become a beautiful macro photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I used a shutter release, tripod, manual focus, and aperture of f5.0. My lens was positioned about 2 inches (5cm) away.</p>\r\n<p>The following photo is nothing more than a dish of soapy water. I love to hear the bubbles popping, and started looking really closely as they disappeared into the air. This particular bubble looked like the eye of some sort of animal, so I quickly set up my camera all the while hoping it would not pop before I got my shot. I was amazed that the bubble had all of the elements of an eyeball. The dark pupil, the blue iris, and even reflections that you would see in a real eye. See what I mean about anything becoming a good subject? Use your imagination and find relationships in ordinary objects.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I used a shutter release, tripod, manual focus, and aperture of f2.2. I was about 2 inches (5cm) away from the bubbles.</p>\r\n<p>The next photograph is a still life that documents the circle of life. I found a rusted tin can and scorched piece of granite rock in an area near my home that a massive wildfire had blown through, almost destroying my small village. The daffodils bloomed six weeks early this year, due to California&rsquo;s drought and warmer than usual weather. I placed the withering daffodils in the rusted can and set then up in a shooting tent. I used two side lights to give them some glow.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My tools were a tripod, shutter release, manual focus. I used an aperture of f8 at a distance of 36&rdquo; (91.44 cm).</p>\r\n<p>Following is a photo of something most of us would never even see. This teeny spider is less than 1/4 inch (6mm) is size. I noticed it because I went out with my camera specifically looking for macro shots. My eyes were dissecting everything and breaking subjects down into the smallest components. I spotted this spider happily basking across the face of this daffodil the the last rays of evening light. The strong yellow color was enhanced by the golden sun, and made an excellent backdrop. Notice how I chose to make the spider the important story in this image. The focus was on it, with an aperture selection that allowed the daffodil to go softly out of focus.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I used all of my trusty tools as in the above images with an aperture of f8. My distance was approximately 4 inches (10cm).</p>\r\n<p>Next is a shot I took for my holiday cards a few years back. I was enjoying this tasty cinnamon apple pie while sitting on my lipstick-red couch. It suddenly popped into my head that the pie would look great with a garnishing of pine cones and red berries against the background of the couch. The late winter afternoon light was spilling directly onto the couch, so I quickly set up the still life before it shifted away. This image has received more comments than any other holiday card I have ever sent. There is a new meaning to the phrase \"watch what you eat\". If you are watching what you eat, you may spot a great macro opportunity.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Guess what my tool were? Yes, the tripod, shutter release, manual focus and an aperture of f11. I closed the aperture of this shot more than the other examples because I wanted as much in focus from front to back as possible. The lens was about 10 inches (25cm) away.</p>\r\n<p>Have some fun, and experiment. Remember, the more you do it, the better you get. Concentrate on getting interesting subject matter at various distances and apertures. We will cover composition, light, and apertures in the next lessons, so I don\'t expect your images to be perfect in this lesson. Just find the beauty in ordinary things. I can\'t wait to see your photos.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 06:27:43','2015-04-17 08:52:10'),(181,58,'Reading the Light - Makes or Breaks the Picture',NULL,'<p><em><strong>\"Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light. Know it for all you are worth, and you will know the key to photography\" - (quote from George Eastman).</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>If you have taken any of my other Compelling Image courses, or been with me in a field workshop, you know that I consider light to be the number one subject in a photograph. You can look at the most boring object in the right light, and it becomes a work of art. Shoelaces, a thumbnail, or a box of nails can turn into gorgeous images if touched by the right lighting. This lesson will teach you how to see in a new way. You will look at the world around you like a professional photographer and assess what will make a good photograph vs. an average snapshot according to the available light. As you learn to look at light, you will find it is the single most important ingredient that makes any object a delight and a surprise.</p>\r\n<p>The word \"photography\" originates from the Greek words phos (light), and graphis (stylus or paintbrush) which when put together mean drawing with light or painting with light. When the definition of your chosen creative field means capturing light, it also means your number one subject matter is light. Take a look at Paul Strand\'s photo of typewriter keys at the following link: http://www.sauer-thompson.com/junkforcode/archives/keys.jpg Notice the overhead light that is slightly to the right. It casts a small shadow on the left side of the keys, giving them more dimension. The light is strong, so it enhances the contrast between black and white. It is your goal to think about light in macro photography the way this master thought about it in his image.</p>\r\n<p>While you are going through the day, look at the light on objects at different times of the day. What does that chair on your patio or balcony look like at 8 a.m., 11:30 a.m., 3 p.m., and at dusk? Notice the color and strength of the light. Are there shadows? How long are they? How dark are they? What effect does light have on the texture of objects? Look at the light coming through your kitchen window at different times of the day. There may be a sink full of dirty dishes in soapy water right now, but if the late afternoon light happens to come in that window at just the right angle, you may have a masterpiece waiting to be captured. How does filtered light create moods? Think of a landscape with light streaming down from broken clouds. This type of light can work in macro images too. Keep your observations in mind when deciding when and where to shoot your assignment.</p>\r\n<p>White balance is important to consider when you are shooting your assignment. Your digital camera is automatically set to an \"Auto\" white balance. This is fine most of the time, but when you have specific lighting conditions, you should change it for the most accurate colors. White balance reads color temperature, and adjusts to record the colors as best it can. No camera is perfect, but they do pretty well. Look at your white balance and see the different settings available. Your camera may vary from mine, but the standard options for most cameras are: Auto, sunny, shade, cloudy, incandescent, fluorescent, flash, custom, and kelvin. For our purposes, you do not need to worry about flash, custom or kelvin. When you are shooting, if you have an overcast sky, change your white balance to cloudy. If it is sunny, choose the sunny setting. If you are indoors, is the light incandescent (regular light bulbs) or fluorescent (tube bulbs)? For most images and situations, the auto setting will be fine. Just be aware of your options and use them to see what effect they have on your photo.</p>\r\n<p>Lets look at some examples of light in macro photography.</p>\r\n<p>The first photo example below is of an unsightful, rusty antique iron with a nasty, biting horsefly on it. Doesn\'t sound like something you would want to photograph, does it? The combination of texture and soft evening light turned this ordinary cast-away object into a beautiful photograph. It is important to note that patience is a virtue with photography. I had taken several images of this iron, and they were acceptable, but something was missing. I swatted this fly off me several times while shooting, and hoped it would land on the iron. I waited. And waited. And waited. At last it landed in the most opportune position, and I quickly focused and got the shot. The addition of the fly makes the image much stronger than the ones without it. The early evening light was coming from a low angle, and positioned from the back and left side of the iron. A low side angle creates a lot of texture on objects, and I knew it would be perfect to bring out the rusty surface of the iron. Low evening light also has a golden hue to it, and I took advantage of it to enhance the rust color even more.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I used a tripod, shutter release, manual focus, aperture at f11. My tripod was set up 7 inches away from the iron.</p>\r\n<p>The next photo example is a situation of window lighting. Can you see how the overhead light gives the thread spools a strong color? Look carefully at the angle the light is coming from. It is overhead, and slightly behind. You can tell this from the small shadows at the base of the front spools. My angle of shooting was from above, so the shadows are apparent. I framed the photo so the thread spools would almost fill the frame and create a pleasing arch shaped composition. This photo works because it makes use of the light to create a strong graphic image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>My tools were the tripod, camera timer, manual focus, aperture of 5.5 at 1/100 sec. I was 18&rdquo; (45.72 cm) away from the set up.</p>\r\n<p>A beautiful staircase at a botanical garden I enjoy visiting is pictured in the next photo example below.&nbsp; I achieved this soft effect with a combination of lighting and a Lensbaby lens with a macro kit. You can ask me about Lensbabies if you want more info about them. Examine the light in this image. It has an even tone with very little shadow. This particular day was overcast, with a thick cloud layer acting as a huge diffuser emanating a steady smooth light. It is as if you were to hang a sheet up to block the sun. This type of light is great for casting a romantic or mysterious mood in your photography. I thought it would be perfect to enhance the antique look of the stairs and bring out the color of the flower petals. We will revisit this photo to discuss composition in the next lesson.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I used my tripod, shutter release, manual focus with an aperture of f8. I placed the tripod about 12\" from the second stair.</p>\r\n<p>Colorful bowls, neatly stacked, forms our next example.&nbsp; I shot this for a client who wanted a feeling of an intimate summer picnic party. This image was shot in mid morning before the sun got too high in the sky. The highlights on the of the rims of the bowls accent instead of distract from their shapes. One thing you must be careful of is harsh highlights. If they are too bright, (called blowouts) your eye will focus on them because they are the brightest area of the photo. This can be so distracting, taking away from your otherwise lovely photo, that you may have to trash it. Take special notice of how sharp the bowls are in contrast to the blurry background of leaves. This is due to my aperture setting. If I had made the background as sharp as the bowls, they would have gotten lost in the background. Keep this in mind for the 4th lesson when we cover depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Tools: Tripod, shutter release, manual focus and an aperture of f4. The camera was 18\" from the bowls.</p>\r\n<p>I came across this final subject below of a beautiful clump of tiny purple wildflowers, during a springtime hike. I was on a path with tall trees on each side. It was mid-day, and the sun was high, but the branches filtered the sun into streams of light . This kind of light can be difficult to shoot because you get very light areas with very dark shadows, making it hard for the camera to meter. If you choose the light parts to meter, the shadows will go black, and if you meter the shadows, the highlights will blowout. How, then, did I get this image? I set the tripod and camera in place for the composition I wanted. Then I waited until the light was shaded over the entire frame except for one shaft shining directly on the center flower. To complicate matters, it was a breezy day, so I also had to wait for the wind to be still while the light was just right. When you are shooting this close to your subject, even the slightest breeze will result in a blurry image. It took about 15 minutes to get the shot I was waiting for.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I used a tripod, shutter release, manual focus, with an aperture of 2.8. I was only 3\" from the flowers.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you are becoming more aware of light and how it brings personality to objects, try your hand at photographing some items you find interesting.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 06:43:38','2015-04-17 07:53:25'),(182,58,'Composition - Ordinary versus Dynamic',NULL,'<p><em><strong>\"Good composition is like a suspension bridge - each line adds strength and takes none away\". Robert Henri</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Robert Henri was a painter, but his quote about composition applies perfectly to photography as well.</p>\r\n<p>Composition is an often overlooked element for beginning photographers. This is perfectly natural considering training you eye to see patterns it is one of the most challenging things to do. This lesson is designed to help you look at objects with the intention of analyzing them for the best photographic compositions.</p>\r\n<p>There are a few different compositional elements to consider. The rule of thirds, leading lines, symmetry, changing the point of view (POV), and balance are the ones we will concern ourselves with in this lesson.</p>\r\n<p>The <em>Rule of Thirds</em> is a classic compositional consideration in all art forms. Our eye seems to appreciate two-dimensional art when it is a little off balance. Think about a rectangle (like the shape of your photographs) and break it up into thirds. Two lines breaking the space vertically, and two lines breaking it up horizontally - as in the diagram directly below.&nbsp; When composing your photo, place the main interest at one of the intersecting thirds instead of in the center. Most of the time, it creates a more dynamic, pleasing composition. There are exceptions, of course, but about 85% of the time, you will find this simple rule works well.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Leading lines are a way of guiding your viewer into, out of, and around your photograph. If you use lines as a tool, you can show your viewer just what captivated you stop and spend time taking the photo. Leading lines work best when there is something of particular interest at the end of the line. Leading lines can be horizontal, vertical, converging, or my favorite, diagonal. Keep in mind, lines do not have to be literal. A shape can become a line if it is strong. A series of rocks, large leading to small from bottom to top can create a leading line.</p>\r\n<p>Contrary to the rule of thirds, symmetry is when you want to place your main interest in the center of your photo. This means giving equal emphasis to both sides of your image. This technique works well with patterns in the natural world. It is tricky to know when symmetry will work better than the rule of thirds, and because this is art, not science, I cannot tell you exactly when I choose to shoot a symmetrical image vs. an off center one. My examples will help you see through my eyes, and hopefully act as a guide to sending you on your way to discerning the difference for yourself.</p>\r\n<p>Balance is often the first consideration I look at in an image to determine the way I will shoot it. Where is the majority of weight? In other words, is there one object that demands more attention than the others? Large vs, small, tall vs. short, bright vs. dull. These are things that determine where your eye wants to land. Should you center the heaviest object, or use the rule of thirds? Which composition makes the strongest statement? I often take several images of the same subject in different compositional situations to compare and select the strongest one after reviewing them all.</p>\r\n<p>Changing the point of view (POV), is a way of looking at an object from a different angle than we are typically use to. When you are deciding to photograph an object, look at it from many different angles. View it from straight on, from above, below, sideways, and from an angle. Which view is the most dynamic? As with balance, I shoot my object from many different angles to see which one is the most interesting.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you have an idea of the different types of compositions available to choose from, lets look at the examples to see how to put them to use. Often, more than one compositional element is used in a photo, and I will point them out when necessary.</p>\r\n<p>The Rule of Thirds grid is a good guide to help train your eye into breaking a whole rectangle into thirds. Some cameras have an option to turn on the grid while you are composing your images. If this helps you, by all means, use it. Once you\'ve mastered this technique, the grid will probably become more of a nuisance than a help, and you can turn it off.</p>\r\n<p>The following image is an example of the Rule of Thirds put to use. It is a very simple photo of a bird nest with eggs I found in the forest. How can you make a simple object interesting? Take note of how the eggs are placed off center in the right third of the frame. It is much more interesting than if they were placed in the center. Another tip is to keep the background simple so there are no competing elements with the nest.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In n the image below, the concept of <em>leading lines</em> is demonstrated.&nbsp; This tropical plant has a very dynamic pattern in its leaves, as well as a complimentary color scheme. The center pink vein leads your eye from bottom to top in a diagonal pattern. Why does your eye follow the vein from bottom to top? Because of the creamy colored \"indian arrow heads\" in the top right third of the image. The shape of the arrow heads also acts as a focal point for your eye because the shape is familiar and we naturally want to find something familiar in photographic images. What other compositional element is at work here? The rule of thirds. I placed the arrow heads in the top right third of the image, making the creamy color shapes the focal point. An important aspect of leading lines is to make sure your eye doesn\'t travel outside the photograph, never to return. The curved veins on both sides of the center vein bend down. They force your eye to travel back into the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The following photo example shows us symmetry. I found this starfish in a novelty store in Seattle, Washington. I have been collecting little shells from beaches that I have visited around the world, and some of them appear in this photo. The starfish is placed in the center of the photograph. The legs are evenly pointed to the sides and front. the little shells are randomly placed around the starfish to add interest and color. Even though this is an example of symmetry, you can see subtle variances that deviate away from total balance, and these differences are what make the image work. Notice that the top right leg is slightly longer than the one on the left. The right front leg raises itself up as if to wave to us, while the left front leg lays flat. Take into consideration the tiny differences in nature when composing your photographs.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next image below demonstrates how <em>point of view</em> can be altered.&nbsp; This is the same photograph you saw in the last lesson as a study of diffused lighting. It is also a perfect example of changing your POV. It is an effective and easy technique. Would this image be more interesting if I had shot it with the stairs in horizontal lines? No. We are so use to seeing horizontal stairs, that we would dismiss the image as nothing special. Changing the POV automatically makes you want to look at it longer than normal. This particular image is captured from a POV above and tilted into a diagonal pattern. Leading lines also play an important role in this composition. The red flower petals bring your eye back to the center of the photo instead of trailing out of the frame while following the diagonal lines. There are many ways to achieve a unique POV. To achieve this angle, I set my camera on a tripod with a ballhead that can be easily tilted and locked into position. It allowed me to move the camera angle around until I found just the right POV.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The image that follows respresents the most complicated example.&nbsp; Balance is the key, but there are more elements involved.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I am always looking for objects to photograph, and while in the Seattle Art Museum, I spotted some perfume bottles on one shelf and marbles on another. The bottle is taller than the marble, so I needed something in common between them. There were many different colors to choose from, but I found a marble and bottle that both contained a spring green color, thus creating a balance. The second commonality is the circular shape. The round stopper of the bottle is repeated by the circular shape of the marble. One circle is small, one large. The difference in size adds a pleasing tension.</p>\r\n<p>Next, I had to decide the best set up for this composition. The bottle and marble were placed next to each other, and I turned the marble around to several different angles until I found the one I thought enhanced both it and the bottle. I used a pure white matt board as a background to intensify the bright candy colors. I still felt there was something was lacking. I realized I needed another common color, so I mixed some red and yellow food coloring in water and poured it in the bottle. This lent a second color harmony of orange between the two. Much better, but still no \"zing\" to the shot. What could I do? The white background was very effective in bringing out the colors, but it was boring. Careful inspection revealed I was utilizing the rule of thirds by setting the objects in the bottom third of the space, but my eye was resting there and not traveling further into the photograph. The answer was to bring in a complimentary color. I used some turquoise wrapping tissue in the background because orange and turquoise are opposite each other on the color wheel (complimentary colors). Compliments provide interest by adding tension. That really kicked off the zinging and zanging. The turquoise color was placed in the top third of the frame balancing the strong oranges of the marble and bottle. I used the rule of thirds twice in this image.</p>\r\n<p>Can you guess what the last compositional element is in the last photo shown above? It is much more sophisticated than the third of our photo examples from the top of this page, but if you look closely, you can see leading lines. The lines form a triangular shape that lead you around the whole image and keeping you inside the frame. The large circle of the marble leads your eye up to the smaller circle of the stopper.</p>\r\n<p>The turquoise color also demands an upward direction. The black line of the stopper forces your eye to travel down into the photograph. Then, the fact that the bottle is sitting on the same plane as the marble makes your eye move across the bottom edge and back up to the marble again. Triangular leading lines are very effective in keeping your eye inside the photo.</p>\r\n<p>To review for a moment - this final photo example employs the <em>Rule of Thirds</em>, twice.&nbsp; It also puts to use - <em>balance </em>and <em>leading lines </em>to form a deceivingly simple composition.</p>\r\n<p>You can now proceed to the assignment for this lesson.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 06:44:54','2015-04-17 08:17:24'),(183,58,'Depth of Field - Storytelling Emphasis & Precision',NULL,'<p>If you have never experimented with depth of field, you are in for an exciting journey.&nbsp; Most people are use to looking at photographs in which the main object has the same amount of focus as the background. In many cases, this causes confusion and the object gets lost in rest the photo. The viewer doesnʼt know where to look. Everything has the same amount of emphasis, and your story gets lost. When you use depth of field well, you can create emotional, artistic foregrounds and backgrounds while the main object is strong and clear. I once had a magazine editor tell me that when he was looking<br />at submissions, he immediately threw out the ones where the photographer did not select a depth of field. This should tell you how important choosing an aperture is.</p>\r\n<p>Aperture, otherwise known as f-stop, is a powerful way to make a statement in your photographs. I like to think of it as the story telling tool. How much or how little you choose to keep in focus can help the viewer understand your story. Macro photography and expert use of aperture can make tiny objects seem monumental, give them authority, and expose the nuances we donʼt normally see. Look for the tiny details that will make your story interesting. These are the points in the image you want to emphasize with depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>What does aperture do? It controls your depth of field. Depth of field refers to the area in front of and behind the focus point in your photograph. Some photos are sharp and clear from front to back, others are sharp only in a very small area, and blurry everywhere else. The f-stop you choose controls how much of the photo you want in sharp focus.</p>\r\n<p>Controlling your aperture is a matter of deciding what number f-stop you want to use.&nbsp; F22 will result in a photo that has a deep (or long) depth of field, meaning the photo will be sharp and clear almost all the way from front to back. If you use f4, the photo will be sharp in a small area where you focus, and everything in front and behind the focus point will be blurred.This is called a shallow (or short) depth of field. Think of it this way: big number, big focus, small number, small focus. The aperture and focal point you choose command the viewer to look exactly where you intend. When you use a deep<br />depth of field, the lens closes down to a small hole, letting a limited amount of light in.&nbsp; Your shutter speed will be longer to compensate for the smaller aperture. When you use a shallow depth of field, the lens opens up and lets in a large amount of light. Your shutter speed is shorter because the lens is letting in so much light.</p>\r\n<p>I suggest you use either the manual or aperture modes of your camera for this assignment.&nbsp; If you use manual mode, you have more creative control to manipulate your exposure compensation for shadows and highlights. Aperture mode allows you to select the f-stop, and the camera matches the shutter speed to the aperture automatically.&nbsp; Manually focus so you can control your focal point. If you leave it up to the camera to automatically focus, it very well may pick the wrong part of your frame.</p>\r\n<p>Most cameras have a depth of field preview button. It is usually located near the bottom of your lens, on the camera body. When you push that button, the opening of the lens adjusts to the aperture you have chosen, and you can see what will be in focus. I recommend using the preview button when you are first learning about depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>Compare the first three photo examples below.&nbsp; This line-up of foil wrapped candy was taken with my 100mm macro lens from a distance of 12\", and the aperture was 4.0. I never moved the camera or the candy. The first picture was focused on the first red candy. Take note of how sharply in focus it is, while the other candies become more blurred as they get further away. The second image of this group was focused on the middle orange candy. See how the candies in front and behind it become blurred?&nbsp; The last photo of these three was focused on the last gold candy, and all of the candies in front of it become more blurry as they get closer to you.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Now weʼll look at an image with a big, or long, depth of field. The image below represents an arrangement of antique bottles. They are on three different planes, each one slightly behind the other. The background is a solid backdrop, so I didnʼt have to worry about clutter fighting for attention with the bottles. I also wanted to make each bottle as important as the others because I liked the fact that they are all equally interesting with dirt and different colors of patina. The composition works well, and the balance between the simple color scheme is easy on the eyes. I chose an aperture of f11 to provide a long depth of field and all of the bottles are in focus because of it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The next image below was taken in the same session as the last above, but has a totally different story. I liked the fact that the blue bottle had cobwebs on it, and especially the cobweb over the opening. How do I make sure the viewer is lead to this particular place in the photograph? First, I placed the bottle in a position leading your eye to the opening, and using different colored bottles in the background to accent the blue. Then, I needed to decide which aperture to use to make the focus on the opening just right, and the rest of the bottles seem less important. I used a 60mm macro lens with an f-stop of f8, and it worked out perfectly.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In this next photograph, an extreme use of depth of field is represented. This wildflower in the Grand Tetons of Wyoming in the U.S., was photographed during one of my workshops. I was showing the students how to get as close as possible, making an artistic image of an average looking weedy flower. This flower is only about 1\" in diameter, but look at the large presence it has in a tight macro shot. I wanted a very painterly effect, like a watercolor, so I chose the most narrow depth of field possible with my 100mm lens - f2.8. Some lenses will go no lower than f4 or even f5.6. Some lenses will let you open up your aperture to f1.8.&nbsp; The resulting image is one where almost everything is softly blurred. This produces a soft and dreamy mood that is not possible when everything is in sharp focus.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I love bats. Did you know they can eat up to 1,000 mosquitoes in an hour? I donʼt know about you, but mosquitoes think Iʼm tasty. I look like I have the measles in summertime.&nbsp; So I love bats because that means I have less bites to endure. In the next picture, I was lucky enough to come across this bat during the day. It was taking a rest on the wall of a wilderness park bathroom. Luckily, I already had my macro lens on my camera so I quickly set up my f-stop to f4 and got as close as I dared. The bat was either too tired or decided I wasnʼt a threat because it let me get within 8\". I thought it was sleeping until I got home and looked at the photo. It was wide awake and staring at me the whole time!&nbsp; The f4 aperture kept its eye and ears in sharp focus and blurred the rest of its body.&nbsp; Keep in mind when photographing animals or people, chances are you will want to keep the eyes in focus.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The final photo example below of an apple martini with a cherry in it, was challenging to photograph.&nbsp; Where was my story? There was so much here to work with. The apples, the cherry, and the glass itself. After exploring every plane of the glass, and even through the glass to the other side, I thought the bubbles were the most interesting part of the image. An aperture of f5 allowed me to focus on the bubbles while blurring the rim, the back of the glass, and a little of the cherry. I wanted to keep enough of the cherry in focus to make it an important part of the photo, but not take away from the refreshing bubbles. What would have happened if I used an aperture of f11? Too much of the martini glass would have been in focus, and the bubbles would have gotten lost in the other details. What would have happened if I used an aperture of f2.8? Only a few of the bubbles would have been in focus, and the rest of the image would not been recognizable.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I trust that by looking at these images, you have a feeling for how depth of field works.&nbsp; Remember, the larger number f-stop you use, the more in focus your image will be. The smaller number f-stop, the less in focus it will be. It is important to get a feel for deciding what the most compelling part of your photograph is. Select that part, and use depth of field creatively to tell your story.</p>\r\n<p>Now itʼs your turn to find your subjects, determine their stories, and choose an effective depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 06:47:35','2015-03-31 06:57:28'),(184,59,'Establishing a Photographic Context',NULL,'<p>Before the digital age, photographers and editors used to sit in their studios, covered in a mountain of slides and negatives. The physical aftermath of a photo shoot could literally bury a photographer alive. Or at least that is what it can feel like.&nbsp; I know first hand, as I experienced the feeling of drowning under a mountain of slides during my experience as a photo editor at a national monthly magazine.&nbsp; I distinctly recall the overwhelming feeling I would experience every week upon meeting the FEDEx delivery man. He would deliver, on behalf of someone who had traveled for what seemed like years at a time,&nbsp; the largest cardboard box known to man -- packed to the brim with slides and negatives. What was not in that box was an editing context. Those boxes of images would haunt me. How could I possibly pick the best image for a one off best shot? How could I possibly decipher a story, or, even worse,&nbsp; the cover shot out of thousands of images? I would sit on the floor of my office, surrounded by the work without a clue of where to start. <br /><br />The digital, modern equivalent to this is a full hard drive, and perhaps you have experienced this in front of your computer screen -- by \'attempting\' to edit your images by procrastinating, perhaps with the help of the internet. The good news however, is that this feeling of doubt and stress is avoidable.</p>\r\n<p>Photo editing is about using the pre-existing knowledge that we have already established as photographers to be the master of your own images. This course aims to give you the tools needed to implement and identify powerful imagery for strong edits. Our aim is to simply establish a framework that is fail proof for any edit.<br /><br />During this course, we will work through each lesson by using examples from your own work to learn how to become more efficient, mindful photo editors. Just as our photography should be sharp and clean, our editing process should be just as exact! <br /><br />As a photographer, you already have a basic knowledge of composition, light, and subject.&nbsp; And you have already planned the shoot and executed taking the images. The work however, does not close when the shutter does. To decipher how to start an edit, we need to look at a few main ideas in order to grasp the work ahead of us. Once we have established which context we are editing for, half of the editing work is already done. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In general, most editing sessions can fall into three categories that will help to find the contextual framework for the images. They are: batch/image processing, story editing, and stand alone singles.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1) BATCH PROCESSING</strong></p>\r\n<p>In a Batch processing edit, we are examining a shoot that was done in one or two settings, with many different frames of similar images. Perhaps this could be a single portrait shoot, head-shots, a sports game, or a continuing series. <br />During the editing process, we will need to use basic photo knowledge to check for quality and content. By applying basic photographic techniques, we can detach ourselves from the emotional draw that can potentially prohibits us from making intelligent editing decisions.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2) STORY</strong></p>\r\n<p>In editing for a story, we are looking for the key images that are meant to comprise the story. It is crucial that the images selected flow together to allow the viewer to further understand a central idea or a theme. It is pictures that tell a story that are most likely to be chosen for a publication or that will draw your readership in.&nbsp; Before editing for a story, we will look for a variety of different shots that will help establish the meaning of your work. Editing through a series or set of images can allow us to tell a compelling story without simplifying or stereotyping.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>3) STAND ALONE IMAGES</strong></p>\r\n<p>A stand alone image is the one perfect image that has captured the \"decisive moment.\"&nbsp; It is the image that shines in the rough of a collection of similar images, and that can act as a stand alone photograph without any other context or imagery. This image is a one off that could be used as an example from your portfolio, or perhaps, a photo for a contest.&nbsp; Is this the one off that your audience will find so powerful that it can speak for itself alone away from a series of images? We will also look at ways to present individual singles alongside one another for portfolio use.<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><br /></span></p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p><br />In this first lesson we will look at the basics of batch editing and processing a large amount of material through a digital editing platform. Before establishing what images we will be able to use for any purpose, you will need to efficiently edit to toss away unnecessary &ldquo;duds&rdquo; (unusable photos)<br /><br />The first rule to adhere to is to stick to basics. When&nbsp; looking at hundreds of images, or perhaps thousands, keep your photo editing software screen (Photoshop, Bridge, Lightroom, Aperture) open to no more than 15 images at a time, in order to be able to do a quick scan of images that are obviously not acceptable. If the image needs to be worked on heavily to compensate for bad exposure, color, contrast, or unintended blur, the image should be deleted immediately.<br /><br />Secondly, it is crucial to separate the emotion from the quality and power of the images we are looking at.&nbsp; Often times, the situation or excitement of a shoot can cloud a photographer\'s judgement when making editing decisions later.<br />The audience should be able to extract basic information from any photo, regardless if they are familiar with the subject matter or not. One question you can ask yourself is, would I find this image interesting if I didn\'t know the backstory? <br /><br />Third. Use your intuition. Scan over your images quickly and see what instantly grabs your attention. Let the natural process of what looks and feels right work. Often times, our first impressions are the right impressions. If you find that you are going back and forth between two images that are very similar, notice which one you originally came to. This is probably the best image.</p>',7,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 13:20:38','2015-03-31 13:20:38'),(185,59,'Applying a Critical Eye',NULL,'<p>Every image can tell a story, but it is the collection of multiple images thoughtfully shot, placed and edited in a specific progression that will help you tell your story. This is the photo essay. The photo essay mimics many devices used in a written essay -- the introduction, body, and conclusion. Though an individual photographers\' storytelling technique will vary in subject matter, there are a few important but simple photo editing rules that will help you to create a myriad of storytelling opportunities with your images. <br /><br />Editing for a photo essay is about identifying and connecting related moments and then applying them to your narrative.&nbsp; The initial step in editing to tell a story happens during the actual shoot itself. If you have worked with a particular theme in mind, been commissioned for a magazine feature, or are working on a long term project, you will most likely have a general idea of which images will help to illustrate these ideas.&nbsp; This pre-planning through interviews, research, and going back to your subject matter from different angles will help you later in the editing process, as you will have more emotive and explanatory imagery to work with in telling your story. Take sufficient time if you can to spend with your subject matter, capturing key moments, overviews and details to create layered depth and feel to your work. Of course, photographic surprises are to be expected in every shoot however, keeping a handful of specific shots in mind will help you connect a variety of situational imagery to a compelling narrative. <br /><br />In general, there are six types of images that make for a strong photographic essay.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1) INTRODUCTORY IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>These images are strong singles that will help to put the rest of the story\'s images into context. An introductory image is a leading image. It will set the visual tone for the story, allowing the viewer to identify and place themselves inside your visual process. Much like the first few paragraphs of a novel, it is the introductory images of your photo story will be the determining factor to both draw in an audience and allow them to stay engaged throughout the piece. Many times this image will be of the location where your story takes place or of the area that your subject resides. The image should be able to create a sense of time and place. When you are looking for an image to introduce your story, it should be eye catching and informative. The introductory image will set the stage for the rest of your essay and will allow your audience to ask questions such as where, how, and what.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #000000;\">PHOTO CAPTION: <em>Thousands of Bhutanese from across the isolated mountain kingdom gather en mass to celebrate the first day of Paro Tsechu. The week long event is an annual religious festival celebrating the life of the Buddhist master Guru Rimpoche.</em></span></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) MEDIUM IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>The medium image brings more information to your audience. The introductory image already has set the the initial tone of the photo essay. The medium image now works as a compliment to the first image, serving the purpose of delivering a more specific detail to the story\'s subject. This shot will help to narrow the story\'s field of depth and should bring your viewer\'s eye into that of you, the photographer. The medium image introduces the more specific theme of the essay. It also allows the viewer to enjoy your particular shooting style. <br /><br />{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHOTO CAPTION: <em>Bhutanese line up to receive blessings from esteemed religious leaders on the festival grounds.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3) SUBJECT/PORTRAIT IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>The subject, or portrait image is one, if not the most important image in the photo essay. The first two images will have hopefully created excitement for the viewer. At this point in your narrative, the audience is now anticipating the meeting of your subject.&nbsp; It is the main event. If your story involves a person, family, animal, or event, this is also your opportunity to wow your audience with a unique portraiture style or technically strong environmental portraits. If your main subject involves a thing or an object, you can apply the same rules.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHOTO CAPTION: </strong><em><strong>A masked monk walks to the festival grounds to lead the hypnotic trance dance, a highlight of the Paro Tsechu festival.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>4) DETAIL IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Detail images are some of the most easily forgotten images, but are crucial to every essay. They help medium, subject, or action images flow together smoothly. They also help provide more information about your subject matter in depth and are often objects or close up shots that help to further deepen the understanding of your subject. Normally detail images don\'t necessarily work on their own as singles; however they act to mirror and compliment ideas already set forth by your subject or portrait image. Detail images act as important fillers or transition pieces, and allow the essay to flow from one point in your topic to another with ease.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHOTO CAPTION: <em>Women and men dress in their most expensive traditional costume during the festival.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5) ACTION IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>An action image adds motion, depth, and emotive color to your essay. Action will bring your subject to life. These images color photo essays with feeling and often times are a way to bring an element of stylistic freedom into your piece.&nbsp; An action image will create the space for your audience to engage with your subject in a tangible manner. An action image is also a great way to demonstrate technical skills or add flair to your story. When an action image is not story appropriate, a unique take on shooting an additional detail image or finding a way to show the main subject in a different light will work.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHOTO CAPTION:</strong> <em><strong>Festival attendees line the perimeter of the festival grounds highly skilled monks perform an elaborate trance dance.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>6) CONCLUSIVE IMAGE</strong></p>\r\n<p>Similar to the introductory image, these are photos that should leave the reader with a powerful visual statement. The conclusive image is more of an optional image, and is meant to act as a bookend to leave your audience with a sense of closure. The conclusive image does not need to wrap up or sum up the story but can be an additional image that could have worked as a leading image or a similarly wider view shot. It can also be an additional detail image that leaves the audience feeling still engrossed in the essay, perhaps even leaving them with a sense of further interest. <br /><br />{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p><strong>PHOTO CAPTION:<em> A sea of colorfully dressed Bhutanese Buddhists flood Paro\'s small town for the remainder of the festival in anticipation of receiving blessings for the new year.</em></strong></p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 13:24:06','2015-03-31 13:24:06'),(186,59,'Singles and Stand-Alone Sequences',NULL,'<p>Singles, or stand-alones, are images that should be able to do just that -- stand on their own. The power of a single image has catapulted amateur enthusiasts\' photographic vision to iconic status for as long as photographs have been available to the masses. Eddie Adam\'s communist guerrilla being executed in a Saigon street during the Vietnam War.&nbsp; Alfred Eisenstaedt\'s post WW II image of an American sailor kissing a woman in Times Square. Robert Capa\'s death of a soldier in the Spanish Civil War. These are all examples of single, iconic photographs have become a part of our internal library for a myriad of reasons. But what did the outtakes look like? And how did these photographers work as their best editors in choosing these images? A photographer\'s ability to select the right image from a stack of their outtakes is one of the biggest factors. &nbsp;<br /><br />In the past, photographers could perform quicker and less tedious edits as the volume of a&nbsp; film shoot averaged considerably less than modern comparison. Once a badly exposed image or uninteresting frame would take up much of a film roll. Photographers would stand in the darkroom, waiting for the seemingly magic chemicals to reveal a single picture\'s visual eligibility.&nbsp; Now, digital\'s seemingly endless possibilities and proliferation of new and mass marketed camera technology has allowed for the ability to shoot thousands of frames. This ability to easily fill a hard drive has made locating, organizing, and editing singles a tougher task than ever. In this lesson we will continue to explore using our objective, critical eye to identify singles out of our work. In our first lesson, we looked at how to&nbsp; detaching the emotional tie to become a harsh self-critic. That resistance to keeping large edits can allow for quicker, more concise batch editing elimination of unusable work. This also applies when identifying and flagging for standalone images.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>IDENTIFYING SINGLES FROM LARGE SHOOTS</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Remind yourself that you are editing to show yourself, and your subsequent clients or audience, your best images. You might have shot 30 frames at a slightly different tilt or angle. Out of those 30 frames there might only be 1 strong image. If there is not a strong single in that 30 frame shot, delete them all. Do not attach yourself to images just because you took the time to \"get the shot.\" If the image is not strong, what pain or time it took to get that image is all in the past. Every picture tells a story, and if the image doesn\'t speak for itself, then it is out of your edit.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2)</strong> A good way of identifying strong singles is to make a few quick edits from every shoot of more than 100 images. Look at the images and make a decisive flag or identify the first 25 images that stand out. From those next 25 images, identify 10 strong contenders. From the 10, your next edit will leave you with 3 images. Once looking at 3 images, it is normally easy to decide what is the standout, single best shot.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3)</strong> If you do not see any singles or strong stand-alones in a shoot, then review once more with fresh eyes the next day. If you still do not see a memorable image, there is a chance there is not appropriate single to work with, and that those images might work as part of a larger shoot for either an essay or will work as complimentary sequential images for a later portfolio.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>STAND-ALONE SEQUENCES FOR A PORTFOLIO</strong></p>\r\n<p>We have already learned how to identify images and sequencing for the photographic essay in our last lesson. If you are like most photographers, you will have a body of work outside the essay which often consists of unrelated singles without a \"home\". A great way to present this work is in some form of a categorical portfolio setting or in a portfolio called \"singles\".</p>\r\n<p>There are endless options for showcasing your work in a sequential manner. Whether you are editing for a book, exhibition, or for an online portfolio, basic tips of sequencing and categorization always apply to help organize your work. Our current photography climate demands that we work with lots of different skill sets. A category based portfolio can showcase many different aspects of your work without losing your photographic identity. A carefully sequenced portfolio can tastefully showcase your technical skill sets, and can also be a powerful platform to showcase previously unused singles in a brighter light.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1) Category</strong></p>\r\n<p>Are you sequencing or organizing images for a particular themed portfolio? Most singles can be filed under categories such as travel, reportage, portrait, landscape, fashion, sport, reportage, and so on. (Occasionally, some singles might cross both boundaries).&nbsp; Our current photography climate demands flexibility in working in many different styles. Organizing images categorically can help you audience understand a body of work with clarity. For example, a portrait portfolio will be comprised of different singles than that of a travel portfolio, however both categories\' images should reflect your style as a photographer.&nbsp; In any categorical portfolio, an average of 10-15 images is the right amount of work to showcase without going visually overboard. If an image doesn\'t fit into a specific category, or if you primarily shoot in one specific genre of work, creating a singles portfolio would be your primary category to work with.</p>\r\n<p>Below are singles from different locations and travel assignments that work together in a categorized travel portfolio:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>2) Style</strong></p>\r\n<p>No matter how versatile you might be as a photographer, one thing should remain clear when sequencing or placing images near one another. Try to keep your style, (including post production processing) consistent throughout your sequencing. Old and new work can sometimes work together, however more often times than not, it is best to keep large deviations in style from your own body of work to specific categories. It can become visually confusion to a viewer to see a single in black and white from shot on 1955 Nikon F2 next to a recently shot color single on a Canon 5D Mark ii. There are of course, exceptions to this rule.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3) Meaning/Relation</strong></p>\r\n<p>In any portfolio or image sequence, one image will be placed or shown after another. It is important to think about the relationship between the images, even if they came from completely different locations, events, or years. Place two images next to one another and review their similarities or differences. Notice if the images \"work\" next to one another by comparing subject distribution, colors, lines, and shapes. Two images, such as the ones used in the example below, might not appear to have obvious relationships to one another, however once placed together, reoccurring and stylistic themes can become present. What do you see?<br /><br />The seemingly unrelated singles from various shoots (below), work together in sequence because of line, color, and subject distribution balance:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-03-31 13:30:03','2015-03-31 13:30:03'),(187,59,'Edit to Tell the Story',NULL,'<p>Hello Editors!

No light is \"bad\" light.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>The word \"photography\" derives from Greek and it means to \"write with light.\" When we photograph something, we are not just recording the subject matter itself that is in front of the camera, we are recording the light that is being reflected back at us from the subject. Varying qualities of light, such as direction and color temperature, or warmth and coolness of the light, cause subjects to appear very different in photographs, and it\'s those factors that usually make the difference between mediocre pictures and great images. As seen the photo below, unflattering light will always make for average and unappealing photos, but interesting light, with rich, dark shadows, strong contrast, and bold colors, will almost always make for more interesting shots.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>One reason that professional photographs look great, whether they\'re studio portraits, enticing product shots, or spectacular landscapes, is that they are lit with very pleasing light. In the case of indoor shots, they are usually lit with banks of expensive studio lighting, soft boxes and reflectors. Outside, the source that pros use is the same wonderful and diverse light source that we all have access to for free: the sun.</p>\r\n<p>Direct sunlight is the lighting condition under which most of us take our photographs. Every day, as the sun makes it\'s journey overhead, it varies in color quality from soft pastel, to rich golden pinkish yellow, to cool shadowed blue, to harsh bright white, and the directional effect from it\'s movement causes it to cast shadows of all sizes as the hours change. As outdoor photographers, we can take advantage of these differing qualities of the light, and once we learn how to make best use of each type of light, we can begin to create more dramatic images that match our own personal vision.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Magic Hour</em>:</strong> The best time to photograph outdoor subjects is usually during the &lsquo;magic hours\' of sunrise and sunset. Those are the times when the sun\'s rays skim the edge of the earth and pass through more of the atmosphere. As demonstrated in the following example, the short blue and violet wavelengths of the sun\'s light spectrum are scattered out of the beam, leaving only the longer rays of red and orange to light our scenes.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>During this time of day, the light is less harsh and shadows become both longer and more pronounced. Colors of the scene are enhanced and rendered with a warmer cast from the prominent yellow and red tones, and the sun lights the scene from a lower angle, instead of directly overhead, as it does at midday. Whereas shots taken at midday tend to render subjects in a rather ordinary and unappealing way, this combination of factors usually produces dramatic, striking photographs that jump right out at the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>Providing that the sky is clear at the horizon, the rich light usually begins to occur anywhere between one and two hours before sunset and after sunrise, with the best light occurring when the sun is closest to the horizon. Varying factors, such as the amount of dust, pollution and moisture in the air will all vary the type of light that is cast upon the scene. Any clouds that are present will begin to light up with the warming light as well, which can add another dynamic element to the scene. Just as the sunset light makes your subjects appear more brilliant, the clouds will continue to become more brilliant as the sun goes down.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Alpenglow</em>:</strong> Alpenglow is a phenomenon that sometimes occurs when the sun is just below a clear horizon. A glowing band of red or pink light illuminates the edge of the opposite skyline and anything in it. Shadows become more muted, but clouds often appear he most brilliant in the few minutes just before sunrise and after sunset. The best examples of alpenglow usually appear on mountains, as exemplified below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>However, this does not mean that we should all put away our cameras during the rest of the day between sunrise and sunset. Great photographs can be taken at any hour, and in fact some types of photography lend themselves very well to midday and even cloudy days, when there is no direct sun. A good photographer knows how to take advantage of these situations and can produce good imagery no matter the time of day .Cloudy Days: While not always the best light for shooting broad scenes that include large parts of the sky, overcast days, when there is no direct sun, are great for shooting close-ups. Clouds diffuse and soften the light, and thus act light a giant softbox for the sun. Cloudy light gives a much softer look in photographs without any harsh shadows, and so these conditions are ideal for shooting in very high contrast locations like in thick forests, and other situations where the prominent levels of bright and dark are too extreme for your camera\'s sensor - as seen in the next image below. These are also great times to move in close and shoot flowers, and other details of nature, as well as portraits, because your subjects won\'t be squinting and you won\'t have to deal with shadowed faces.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>However, there are always exceptions to the rule, occasionally, the thick, overcast clouds can play an important part in the scene as illustrated in the image below. The cloud cover in the next shot is certainly a feature element and it adds a dynamic quality to the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Position of the Sun:&nbsp;</strong> </em>As the sun makes it\'s journey across the sky, the direction and length of the shadows that it casts also changes with the hours. Learning how to use the direction of the light is also an important step towards taking better pictures. By changing the position of the sun in your compositions, you can create some very bold and interesting images, no matter what your subject. Let\'s explore some different examples.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Side-Lighting</em>:</strong> Leading male movie stars in the golden era of Hollywood were often lit with side lighting, because it gave them a rugged, bold and mysterious look. This technique is a great way to give your own compositions a more complex and dynamic feel, and using side lighting on any subject will give the shot more depth and dimension than front lighting. It will also give you very pronounced shadows, which is great for landscapes. Remember, the later in the day you shoot, the longer your shadows will be, as we saw in the very first photo example, above.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Back-lighting</em>:</strong> Perhaps the biggest benefit of using backlighting when photographing people, is that your subjects won\'t have to squint because they won\'t be facing the sun. This allows for more relaxed portraits. Backlighting also gives a more even textured light to your subjects, which can sometimes be a very appealing look. When shooting subjects in this kind of light, you might want to move in closer so that you don\'t have too much contrast with the background, which will be much brighter. Shooting backlit portraits in this method at the end of the day can yield photos where your subjects are outlined with a golden &lsquo;halo\' of sunset light.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Silhouettes</em>:</strong> Silhouettes are very powerful photographic effects that also use backlighting, the difference being, that you let your main subject fall into shadow against the brightly lit background (usually the sky). This only works, though if your sky is either a deep rich blue, or if it is tinted by the colors of the setting sun. The most common way to shoot a silhouette is to place a human figure in front of a sunset sky, although any subject can make a good silhouette, and with any shot, the more dynamic the subject, the more interesting your silhouette will be. Take a look at the final photo example below to see just what I mean.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>To create the desired effect, use your desired metering technique to expose for the background, instead of your subject. This will portray your subject in shadow against a perfectly exposed sky, and if you place the sun behind the subject, you can create an even more dynamic effect. Since digital cameras allow you to see the results immediately, don\'t be afraid to experiment with your exposures until you get the look you want. When shooting silhouettes, make sure that your camera\'s flash is turned off.</p>\r\n<p>The visual result of a good silhouette is that you create an image that is no longer about the subject itself but a powerful representation of the feeling or concept of the subject or activity that the subject is engaged in. Since the shadowed subject is usually not recognizable, it allows viewers to imagine themselves in the scene.</p>\r\n<p>With the endless qualities of light that each day brings between the sun and clouds, the opportunities for taking great photos are also endless. Experiment with different lighting conditions and subject matter and you\'ll discover some amazing possibilities.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 07:40:01','2015-04-01 07:51:33'),(189,60,'Capturing Landscapes',NULL,'<p><em><strong>Capturing the outdoor \"Hallmark\". Power compositions. Choosing the right tool.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Landscapes are the hallmark of outdoor photography, and many photographers have defined their style through shooting scenes of the natural world. As outdoor photographers, landscapes speak to many of us more than any other type of subject, perhaps because of our inherent connection with nature and because the process involves a solitary and individual method of actively seeing the world in our own way.</p>\r\n<p>Even if you are not specifically drawn to creating powerful images of the natural world, shooting landscapes is a great way to practice your compositional and technical skills. The techniques you learn here can be applied to just about any type of photography, whatever your preferred style.</p>\r\n<p>Like any good photograph, a good landscape includes the elements of proper exposure, appealing light, and a pleasing use of form, subject, texture and lines. But what sets a great landscape apart from those that are just good? The answer is not always explained in tangible terms, and it has to do with the overall feel of the image.</p>\r\n<p>A great landscape image goes beyond simply documenting the location, it actually communicates a certain power and emotion to its viewers, one that transcends time, place or familiarity of the subject itself and works its way into the consciousness of the viewer. It allows a single moment in time and place to become a universal visual idea of that specific location, or in some cases, a powerful representation of the type of region in which it was made, even though it may not be identifiable to the viewer. Most importantly, they transmit the photographer\'s own personal ideas about the scene to the viewer, which might be defined as concepts such as majesty, tranquility or wonder.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Light:</strong></em> A successful landscape basically requires a combination of great light and strong subject matter. Sometimes during the process, you will first find a subject that attracts you, in which case the idea thing to do is to wait for better light, or return at a different day or time. Other times, you will be faced with extraordinary light, such as a brilliantly colored sky, or a dynamic cloud formation that is lit by the setting sun. The approach to take in these situations is to search for a subject in the landscape to match against the spectacular light. Often these situations will result in a silhouette, whereas other times you will find an element in the landscape is lit directly by this light, such as a rock or mountain formation, a tree, or some grass of flowers, etc... To actively search out a subject that will effectively match the light is a more dynamic approach, and it usually requires quick thought and action, but both can result in great images.</p>\r\n<p>In the first photo example below, I knew that I wanted to photograph the two scenes below, and so I set up and waited for the optimum light. The first image was taken at sunrise, while the second shot was taken at the end of the day.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In the two images below, I encountered the impressive light first and then quickly searched for subject matter that would compliment it. In the first image, that involved skiing around in the forest, looking for the right scene of trees. In the second image, it involved driving for a few miles until I could was able to match the sandstone tower with the moon.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Subjects:</strong></em> The best landscapes portray simplicity in their subject matter. Usually, this means focusing on one important element in the scene, or better yet, the relationship between one element and another, or a few others in the scene. This does not necessarily mean composing the shot to only include your desired subject, because then you lose the sense of place, which may be a very important factor to the image. The key is to accentuate the subject, whether through effective use of your lenses, (see below) or through the placement of the subject in the frame.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Edges of the World:</strong></em> Some of the most dynamic locations for shooting landscapes are the places in the world where elements converge. These are where sky meets earth, land meets water, warm meets cool, or different types of terrain come together. These locations offer excellent possibilities for creating images that show relationships in nature, because you already have a scene where two or more elements play off of each other. Examples of this can be reflections of some colorful clouds in a pond, a rushing stream next to the still grasses on it\'s bank, the warmly lit ridge of a mountain range jutting up into the cool sky, or into the clouds, or where brilliantly clouds meet the shadowed horizon. The possibilities are endless in nature, and are only limited by your own eyes and exploration.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>How the Camera Sees:</strong></em> The human visual system is far more advanced than any camera system. Our eyes are capable of discerning a total contrast range of about thirty stops, and a simultaneous range of about 17 stops, which allows us to view subjects that are brightly light by the sun and distinguish details that are in all but the darkest shadows at the same time, and vice versa. Even the best digital sensors, which have a dynamic range of about 8-10 stops, are unable to record this amount of contrast without compromise.</p>\r\n<p>Since most landscapes are made up of about 18 stops of brightness between the brightest whites and the darkest shadows, this means that the camera is unable to reproduce the entire scene without either blowing out the highlights, or losing all shadow detail in a solid tone of black. To complicate matters even more, most printers are only able to reproduce about 5-6 stops of brightness.</p>\r\n<p>As photographers, not only do we need to be aware of the limitations of our equipment, we need to learn how to use them to our advantage. The first thing to realize is that we\'ll never be able to create image that show detail in both the highlights and the shadows at the same time, so the optimum solution is to expose for the brightest parts of your scene, and let your shadows drop to black. If there are any important elements in the darker areas of your scene that you don\'t want to lose, you\'ll want to recompose the shot so that you exclude as much of the brighter areas as you can. Otherwise, they\'ll reproduce in the final image as a wash of pure white, which is seldom very appealing in a good photo.</p>\r\n<p>To apply this in a practical method, the best approach is as follows: When you\'re dealing with great light, use it to the fullest. Compose the shot around it and let your shadows drop to black. Nothing important goes into the shadows, unless you\'re shooting a silhouette.</p>\r\n<p>Using Different Lenses: Lenses are your camera\'s eye to the world, and they determine the overall look of your imagery. One of the most basic ways to vary the look of your images is to shoot your scene with lenses that have different focal lengths than standard 50mm lenses.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Wide Angle (12-35mm):</strong></em> By the nature of their name, wide angle lenses allow you to show wide views of your scene, and thus are great for spacious, broad landscapes. They typically have a very wide depth of field, so in addition to showing a grand perspective, you can hold focus on very close subject matter all the way to infinity. They are great for showing how a subject relates to its environment, because you can move in close and focus on one particular element and still show some or all of the entire background. Take a look at the photo example below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Telephoto Lenses (70mm and up):</strong></em> The most common use of longer focal length lenses is shooting subjects that are farther away so that they don\'t look too small in the frame. Telephotos bring the subject closer and allow you to isolate subjects from the rest of the scene and feature one or more important elements in your images, rather than just showing the entire scene. The most effective use of telephoto when shooting landscapes is to eliminate the foreground, unless you find a way to make it an important element in the scene. Because of the short depth of field that these lenses offer, foreground subjects will usually appear out of focus, and if they don\'t add to the scene, then they\'ll only end up as distractions.&nbsp; Study the characteristics of telephoto lenses in the photo example, below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>In addition, they add some compression to your scene, which gives the image a much more two-dimensional look. This effect allows you to isolate your subjects against a soft background with a very shallow depth of field and create images that really draw the viewer\'s eye on the specific details that you\'re focusing on.</p>\r\n<p>When using telephoto lenses, your photographs become more about your subject directly, rather than how it relates to its surroundings, although sometimes it\'s very effective to include a second, out of focus element in the background.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 07:42:35','2015-04-01 08:01:07'),(190,60,'Photographing People in the Natural World',NULL,'<p>Photographing people engaged in outdoor activities can be both challenging and rewarding. It\'s a great way to document your own adventures, and since we are inherently drawn to images of the human figure, adding people to your scenes can increase the visual impact of your photos and make for a very dynamic style of imagery. Just as there are endless ways to explore and enjoy the wonders of the natural world, there is a great variety of opportunities to photograph people in the outdoors, whether they\'re engaged in active sports, working outside or simply strolling through a beautiful landscape.</p>\r\n<p>In this lesson, week we\'ll look at two different approaches to shooting people outside. First we\'ll cover the basics of action photography, and then we\'ll look at how to compose effective shots of people as they interact with the landscape.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Action Photography:</strong></em> Shooting action usually means capturing your subjects in a moment of physical exertion, or in the middle of some athletic challenge or accomplishment. A great action photo compresses an entire event into a single instant frozen in time. It shows us in detail, a moment that, in reality, went by much to fast for us to be able to fully comprehend. It allows us to study that one moment and thus see and understand just what the subject endured during the course of the event.</p>\r\n<p>Action photography requires a degree of mental sharpness, so that you can quickly and successfully analyze the scene, as well as technical proficiency. Below is a list of some important elements to consider when shooting action.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Efficiency with your equipment.</strong> Waiting for the action to unfold is no time to be fumbling with your camera or lens or scrolling through menus and options in the LCD panel. A solid working knowledge of how your camera operates is crucial to getting good action photos. You\'ll want to set your exposure and focus, and any other camera parameter that the situation might require as quickly as possible. Essentially, you want your technical skills with the camera to be second nature, and the way to achieve this is through practice, practice, and more practice.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Shutter speed- fast or slow?</strong> Often times you\'ll want to freeze the action so that your subject is dead sharp in the image, while other times you may want to create a blurred image, which communicates motion. To freeze the action, you\'ll want to use as fast a shutter speed as possible, preferably over 1/500 sec, while a slower shutter speed, usually under 1/30 sec and slower will give you a blurred subject. Which technique to use will depend on what kind of image you want to create.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Peak of the action.</strong> Action photography is all about being in the right place at the right time, and the best way to capture the peak of the action is to anticipate when and where it will occur. Studying your subject or having an understanding of how the scene will play out before you will allow you to put yourself in the right place, so that you can press the shutter at the right time. This might mean placing yourself somewhere, pointing the camera and waiting for the subject to come into the frame. Also, look for peaks in the subject\'s expressions in addition to high points in the action.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Shoot in continuous mode.</strong> By shooting in continuous high-speed mode, you can capture an entire series of the action and have more images to choose from when looking for that single great image.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Pan with the subject.</strong> Sometimes you\'ll want to follow the subject through the scene with your camera as you click off frames in continuous mode. Try to keep the subject in the same relative position in the frame as you pan. Using this technique with a slower shutter speed can produce some very strong results. Take a look at the top image in the photo examples below.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Get Close.</strong> Action photography lends itself well to shooting very tightly composed shots. Zooming in and filling the frame with your subjects can be a very effective way to make your pictures much more dramatic and eye catching. Now look at the bottom example in the photo above.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When composing for action shots, look for striking visual scenes that convey simplicity and the exertion or determination of your subject. When it comes to graphic elements and backgrounds, go for bold and look for good light and unique vantage points. Action shots can be about strong facial expressions, dynamic body positions or physical details. Experiment with different lenses and techniques.The second approach to shooting people in the outdoors that we\'ll cover is capturing people in their environments. Often my favorite kind of image and a defining element of my photographic style, these kinds of shots show people engaged in some form of interaction with the landscape, whether they\'re involved in a sport or simply enjoying the outdoors. A good &lsquo;environment\' shot can be a very powerful and often inspirational image.</p>\r\n<p>By showing a person interacting with the world around them and focusing on how they relate with the scene, you give the shot more depth and dimension. The environment now becomes the secondary subject element, which plays off of the obvious importance of the person in the picture. The nature of this interaction can be anything from someone hiking, biking, skiing or running through an impressive landscape, working in a beautiful garden that they\'ve created; anything that you can imagine.</p>\r\n<p>The key to making this work, though, is that environmental element of the shot must be shot in such a way that if the person where not present, it would still be an interesting picture. You can ensure this by approaching the scene backwards. Compose your shot as if you were trying to create a strong image of the space itself, and then think about where you want to place the person in order to portray the vision that you have of the scene. The most successful images of this type are as much about the environment as they are about the people in them, and since people are such prominent subjects, they don\'t necessarily need to be very large or close to carry impact. Even a very small human figure in the shot can lead to a very strong image.</p>\r\n<p>When shooting these kinds of pictures, look for an impressive background first and then think about where you would want the person to appear in the scene, taking into account the activity that they\'re doing. Then think about whether you want to show the specific expressions or highlight the actions of your subject, or whether you want them to simply be a \"human figure in the landscape.\"</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>While many times these shots can be taken on the fly with very good results, (which of course requires a quick eye on your own part) other times you might want to direct the image creation process a little bit. Don\'t be afraid to tell your subject where to stand, what to do and to perform an action again if you don\'t think you nailed the shot on the first try.</p>\r\n<p>Occasionally, the line between action shots and environment shots will overlap, and you\'ll find that it\'s possible to create an image that successfully incorporates both action and environmental elements. Done well, these combination shots are usually the most powerful type of \"people in the outdoors\" imagery.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 07:44:40','2015-04-01 08:12:03'),(191,60,'Creativity is Key',NULL,'<p>Anyone can take great digital photos. It doesn\'t take a seasoned pro or the most expensive equipment to capture a great image. It takes an artistic eye, being in the right place at the right time, and the knowledge of how to use your gear. And, like anything else, it takes practice. The more you shoot, the better photographer you\'ll become.</p>\r\n<p>That said, there are some essential compositional methods that you can use to help you create stronger images. In this lesson, we\'ll explore some techniques that can help you see and shoot more creatively and discuss how to convey your own thoughts about your subject into more successful images.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Backgrounds:</strong></em> The background (and sometimes the foreground) provides the setting for your subject and depending on the strength of your background, it can make or break the shot. Go for simplicity when choosing your background so that you don\'t distract from the main subject and choose one that provides enough information so that it gives the image a sense of place.</p>\r\n<p>In the two shots of hikers below, the bottom image has much more impact, simply because the background is so much more dramatic. The large mountain looming in the fog gives the image a stronger sense of place and awe than the empty blue sky of the first shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>A dark background set behind a lit subject is particularly effective, especially when the background is in shadow or a shadow itself. Backgrounds that are out of focus behind a sharp subject are also very effective, a technique that is easy to do when using longer focal length lenses. When shooting silhouettes, a more dramatic sunset will almost always make for a more interesting image than simple dark blue sky.</p>\r\n<p>In the next shots below of the woman setting up the tent, I was actually drawn to the background first when I saw how the sunset was unfolding. I quickly looked around to see how I could use it and decided on the tent setup idea. The first shot was taken in an entirely different location and as the background is not nearly as exciting, the shot doesn\'t have nearly the same impact as the second.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Often you\'ll have to move around and change your vantage point in order find or fine tune the right background for your frame. When shooting moving subjects or more dynamic scenes, such as sports and people interacting with the landscape, you\'ll want to choose your background first and work back from there, thinking about where you want to your subject to appear against it.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Framing:</strong></em> One of the most important things to consider when taking a photo is where to place your subject in the frame. The position of your subject determines the overall balance of your composition and it can make the difference between an interesting picture and a boring picture.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest rule to follow is to keep the subject out of the center. To help us easily find what we need in life, the human visual system is geared towards balance. While this works for many areas of life, photographs with perfect order tend to be very static and uninteresting. They almost appear too balanced, because the world itself is filled with randomness and asymmetry. By placing your subjects off center and at random points in the frame, you can create images that are more dynamic and appealing, and thus, more natural. Images with more random composition generally evoke a stronger visual response from the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>One method for determining subject placement is to use the \"Rule of Thirds.\" The rule states that if you divide the frame of your image into three equal sections both vertically and horizontally, you create four lines and four points at which these lines intersect. By placing important elements of your composition along lines and on these intersections, you create images that reflect the natural asymmetry of the world. While you don\'t have to follow the rule to a \"T\" with every shot, become familiar with the Rule of Thirds and see how it can help you create stronger images.</p>\r\n<p>In the following shot of the mountain, I\'ve placed the most important compositional element, the summit, out of the center of the frame. In the shot of the hiker sitting on the rock, I\'ve placed him towards the left third of the frame, which has him looking across the rest of the frame. Often, when you have someone looking or moving through the frame, it\'s best to have them moving or looking into the frame instead of out of it towards the short side.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Empty space:</strong></em> One ways to achieve simplicity in your photographs is to use generous portions of empty space in your compositions. By placing your main subjects against large open backgrounds, you make the subjects stand out more and create a stronger sense of balance in your photos. You\'ll also find that this empty, or negative space can often be a very important visual element on its own.</p>\r\n<p>Empty space can be large shadowed areas, expanses of open sky or clean, uncluttered parts of a landscape. The amount of empty space you use can depend on the strength of your main subject. Generally, the more powerful the subject, you the more space you can include around it. By combining this technique with the ideas about framing your subjects that we explored in the previous example, you can create some very dramatic and eye catching photos.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Vantage Points:</strong></em> Out of the millions, if not billions of photos that are taken every year, most of them are shot from roughly the same vantage point: between five and six feet above the ground. This is the average height of the human body, and since most people shoot photos while standing upright with the camera held at eye level, there is very little variation in how most images look.</p>\r\n<p>Varying your vantage point is a very easy and effective way to give your images a unique look. We are not used to looking at the world from any other view than from our own eye level, and so any photo that is taken from a drastically different vantage point will inherently appear more interesting to us.</p>\r\n<p>Changing your vantage point can be as simple as standing on top of something, crouching down or lying on your belly on the ground. Or it can involve using more elaborate methods to get you or your camera into a higher or lower position, such as shooting from on top of a boulder or cliff, or up in a tree. You don\'t always have to hold your camera to your eye; &lsquo;shooting from the hip\' so to speak, or holding your camera very close to the ground or near your subject can lead to some very dynamic imagery.</p>\r\n<p>You can also hold your camera onto the end of an extended tripod like a motion picture camera boom or attach it to different objects by using special clamps that are designed for such purposes. Using these clamps, I\'ve attached my cameras to bicycles and other moving vehicles and used the self-timer or radio controlled remote triggers to fire the shutter. The possibilities are endless, and only limited by your imagination and equipment. What\'s the picture about?</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>\"What\'s the Picture about?\" This simple question is perhaps the single most important ingredient towards creating better photographs. Without it, you run the risk of making boring, cluttered, distracting pictures where nothing interesting stands out. Reactions to such weak images usually result in very quick and uninterested review by your audience, who remember very little, if anything at all about the shot as soon as it\'s passed.</p>\r\n<p>This goes completely against the effect that most of us desire with our photography, which is to create strong images that impact the viewer and have a lasting impression. The strongest images not only captivate the audience in the moment, they imbed themselves in viewer\'s minds and are remembered long after they have seen the shot.</p>\r\n<p>Before taking a photograph, you must first decide what\'s going to be included in the picture. Usually, there is something about the scene that attracts you enough to want to take the shot in the first place, whether it\'s a specific feature in the landscape, person or the color of the light that is falling on the scene. Or, it might be multiple elements of a scene that attract you, as is often the case with landscapes. By identifying the most important subject matter in your scene, you take the first step towards composing a good image. However, it is not the only step, nor is it the most crucial.</p>\r\n<p>After deciding what needs to be in the image, next decide what doesn\'t. This is often a more difficult process, but it can lead to much better photographs. (Remember the adage: \"Less is more.\") As you look through your camera, pay attention to everything in your scene and then try to remove any distracting or unnecessary elements in the composition. This is done most easily by changing your camera position, by waiting, (a few seconds or a few hours) or by zooming in our out with your lens. Aim for a scene in which all the elements in your scene are related in some way, whether they compliment or contrast each other. A simple image is usually the stronger one, and often that means narrowing your scene down to one important visual element, or perhaps two or three that play off of each other somehow.</p>\r\n<p>The viewfinder is your canvas and ultimately, you control what goes onto it. So from now on, before you snap the shutter, ask yourself \"What\'s the picture about\" because if you don\'t know, then your viewer\'s probably won\'t either.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, understand that the best images do not just happen. Snapshots just happen, but a strong image is a product of vision, anticipation, technique, creativity and sometimes a little bit of luck. Making good images takes effort and personal engagement with the subject matter, and the energy that you apply to the process will be reflected in the final image, below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 07:46:08','2015-04-01 08:14:33'),(192,38,'Prepare Your Portfolio',NULL,'<p><strong>There are two important parts to this Portfolio Review:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Part I:</strong>&nbsp; You will see an assignment to this lesson titled \'<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>Submit Your Portfolio</strong></em></span>\' - here you can upload <strong>either</strong>:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A 12-image portfolio, including descriptions of each photo and a description of the overall set (optional).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Two productions - either one video and one multimedia piece (each of approximately 2 1/2 - 3 minutes in length) <strong>OR</strong> two of the same category. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Part II:</strong>&nbsp; Ami will then critique your work on the TCI website and arrange with you a convenient time for a Skype call of approximately 30 minutes duration to summarize views on your work and to give constructive advice and suggestions for its improvement - and your next step forward!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>We hope you thoroughly enjoy your personal Portfolio Review!</em></strong></p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 13:55:16','2015-04-01 14:39:06'),(193,61,'Prepare Your Portfolio',NULL,'<p><strong>There are two important parts to this Portfolio Review:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Part I:</strong>&nbsp; You will see an assignment to this lesson titled \'<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>Submit Your Portfolio</strong></em></span>\' - here you can upload <strong>either</strong>:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>A 12-image portfolio, including descriptions of each photo and a description of the overall set, if you care to.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Two productions - either one video and one multimedia piece (each of approximately 2 1/2 - 3 minutes in length) <strong>OR</strong> two of the same category. <br /><br /></p>\r\n<p><strong>Part II:</strong>&nbsp; Bob will then critique your work on the TCI website and arrange with you a convenient time for a Skype call of approximately 30 minutes duration to summarize views on your work and to give constructive advice and suggestions for its improvement - and your next step forward!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>We hope you thoroughly enjoy your personal Portfolio Review!</em></strong></p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 13:57:00','2015-04-01 14:39:44'),(194,62,'Prepare Your Portfolio',NULL,'<p><strong>There are two important parts to your Portfolio Review:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Part I:</strong>&nbsp; You will see an assignment to this lesson titled \'<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>Submit Your Portfolio</strong></em></span>\' - here you can upload:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Your 12-image portfolio, including descriptions of each photo and a description of the overall set (optional).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Part II:</strong>&nbsp; \"Akash\" will then critique your work on the TCI website and arrange with you a convenient time for a Skype call of approximately 30 minutes duration to summarize views on your work and to give constructive advice and suggestions for its improvement - and your next step forward!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><em>We hope you thoroughly enjoy your personal Portfolio Review!</em></strong></p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-01 14:37:21','2015-04-01 14:37:21'),(195,63,'Capturing Magic Moments',NULL,'<p>There isn&rsquo;t a parent out there who doesn&rsquo;t want wonderful photos of their kids and this can be a very fun and fulfilling area of photography.

Whatever the motivation, there are basics that will make it a rewarding experience for the both the photographer and the child.</p>\r\n<p>A successful shoot is when the parents are happy with the final results, the child had such a good time they didn&rsquo;t realize it was all a coordinated effort to take photos, and no one ended up in tears, including the photographer. It pays to have humor when working with kids &ndash; it can be humbling! Kids being kids will call you out and not cooperate if they aren&rsquo;t having fun and being allowed to be themselves. And since there is nothing cute about a fake smile in a staged photo, your aim will be to capture that moment when you see that authentic giggle, that expression of wonder, or that something special that is unique to that child.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s all about the eyes. The eyes truly are a window into the mind and soul of the child whether they look directly at the camera, or at something that has caught their imagination. Kids eyes sparkle and tell us so much about the child&rsquo;s personality. Some photographers spend a lot of time in post-production manipulating images, tinting the colors, making all sorts of creative effects, and whitening and brightening the child&rsquo;s eyes. It isn&rsquo;t real or true and I have found that kids eyes twinkle without me making them look surreal in post-production. Of course dark circles under the eyes or redness can be corrected but I try not to alter the child&rsquo;s real look so that it is more true to what the parent sees day to day.</p>\r\n<p><br />Someone once paid me the compliment &rdquo;You shoot like a parent would shoot, from the heart. You caught that expression that comes and goes so quickly and I am so happy you got it and now I can remember it forever.&rdquo; That fleeting expression is the magic moment and the image the parent will treasure. In this case, the subject was a two-year-old boy who was surprised when a loud bell rang suddenly behind him in the playground, and the look of surprise and the subsequent giggle was priceless. That was the &ldquo;look&rdquo; that struck a chord with the Mom. The shoot is for them, to capture their child, not just the whole scene, staged and contrived to make a cute image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Lots of kids today are completely used to having their pictures taken as Mommy or Daddy has been taking phone pictures of them since the moment they were born. Phone cameras and digital cameras are normal parts of most kids&rsquo; days and they think it is fun to look at themselves on the display right after taking a photo. They know what they look like in pictures and are very camera-aware. Now someone else is taking the photos, so you need to establish a friendly atmosphere to get them to be natural and not to pose too much or be too much of a ham. Never squash these tendencies of the kids though, or they will freeze up and become shy. Let them do their thing and then ask them to try another idea, this time yours. You are a team, just having fun together and their ideas are just as valuable as yours.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Locations are really important when photographing kids. Using their natural environment as much as possible makes it easier for them to be themselves and to relax and have fun. Kids love to play outdoors and there are lots of places where kids will be able to move and have a variety of things to stimulate them and keep them interested. Playgrounds, parks, fence rows on farms, barns, beaches, graffiti walls, steps and stairs, etc. are all good places to start when looking in your own area. Keep in mind what else will appear in the photos to keep a graphic element, and what will distract the eye away from the child. You want the subject to be the most important part of the image.</p>\r\n<p>Channeling your own inner child will help you relate to your subject in a more realistic way. With really small toddlers and little kids, get down to their eye level to talk to them, and to shoot. Think carefully about the entire scene so you can choose the right lens. Use an 85mm if you are shooting quite close, and a 50mm if you want to capture more of the scene around the child. Kids move fast and in order to control the situation you need to be faster, so be ready to get up and down and to make quick changes. Bigger kids love to show off a bit, like doing their special dance, showing their latest trick on the skateboard, doing the cartwheel they just learned, or telling you about their crush at school.</p>\r\n<p>Considering the time of day you choose to shoot can make the difference between a happy child and their alter ego &ndash; the crabby, tired, hungry child. You definitely want that happy child for your photo shoot. So that means choosing the right time of day, bringing water and small snacks, dressing according to the weather, and being flexible to know when you reach the point of no return and the child is not going to enjoy the shoot that day and it is time to reschedule. If you plan to shoot outdoors on location, check the weather forecast and the child&rsquo;s napping and eating schedule and work with those factors in choosing your shoot time. Bigger kids are fresher if they haven&rsquo;t been at school all day or stayed up all the night before at a sleepover. Timing can make or break a shoot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes the parent will have a concept in mind and that can give you an idea of what they are hoping to get in the photos. Seeing an inspiration picture ahead of time can be really helpful in planning the shoot as long as the parents realize that recreating a shot exactly is not possible given all the different factors. Others just want you to do your own personal style of photography and want you to art direct the shoot. Kids don&rsquo;t really like to have their playtime interrupted to change outfits, so planning for just one change mid-shoot for variety is usually the limit for most kids. Child models are used to having their clothing changed frequently on photo shoots so they tend to roll with it and get back into photo-mode fairly quickly. A typical shoot for a small child up to about age six should only last about 45 minutes. Bigger kids last up to two hours. That is plenty of time to accomplish great pictures and allow for a break for a snack or water, outfit change or just a few minutes of off-camera time.</p>\r\n<p>The natural flow of the kid&rsquo;s imagination and playfulness will influence the shoot. I let kids interact with the environment to get things going. For instance, if I have a little boy who loves to run and I have outdoor stairs, I might ask him to hop down the steps towards me. If I have a little girl who is taking dance classes and likes to twirl I might find an open space where she can spin and not bump into things. Toddlers like to go down slides, so it makes a cute shot to be at the bottom to get that look of excitement on their face as they come down towards you. Small toddlers who might be harder to contain can sit on chairs, or in wagons, or be in a swing. Remember to never put the kid&rsquo;s safety at stake and always use extra caution as there is no point at all in anyone getting hurt for a photo. If the kid says they like to climb trees it doesn&rsquo;t mean they are good at it &ndash; common sense cannot be overstated when working with kids.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>If kids feel like you are playing with them, enjoying them, and encouraging them, they will be your best ally in achieving great shots. They will sense the team-work and want to make you happy. High fives at the end of every shoot for all kids, even the ones who struggled and weren&rsquo;t into it. They are kids after all and each time they do photos they will be more and more comfortable with the process. Positive comments make for a great experience for the kids. Let them enchant you and inspire your photography.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-02 07:32:46','2015-04-06 09:54:37'),(196,63,'Infants & Small Children: A Special Dynamic',NULL,'<p>Capturing images of toddlers is specialty unto itself and can be fun for both the child and the photographer if you are prepared and have the right approach.&nbsp; These are the images the parents will treasure forever, when their toddler starts to grow and be a bit more independent and shows a growing interest in the world around them.&nbsp; This is the best time to capture the kids just being themselves.<br /><br />The photographer&rsquo;s goal is to capture the child in their world at that fleeting moment.&nbsp; Wear sneakers! You will be running, climbing, following, bending, leaning, laying down and generally in perpetual motion, because the toddlers are, and you need to keep up!</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Never underestimate the power of play. Having fun and playing helps kids to grow and learn.&nbsp; It is the time to explore and experience, challenging the them as they interact with their environment.&nbsp; Letting the kids be themselves and to play is natural and let&rsquo;s you freeze those moments.&nbsp; If you are doing it right, the kids will think you are just playing them rather than trying to execute a photo shoot. &nbsp;<br /><br />Choose a safe place to shoot so that the kid can have a little freedom of movement without everyone worrying they will come to some sort of harm.&nbsp; Playgrounds and open grassy parks are usually pretty good options.&nbsp; Aim for a background that isn&rsquo;t too busy or distracting.&nbsp; If it is too cold or too hot the child will tire easily, so dress them appropriately and bring a back up outfit just in case they get really dirty.&nbsp; If the child is in a better mood in the morning, then aim to shoot at that time.&nbsp; Bring water and a small snack to give the child a chance to relax for a few minutes and to break up the play so they can last a bit longer.&nbsp; Usually a shoot with a toddler will last about forty five minutes to an hour.<br /><br />If the child is unfamiliar with you, it is a good idea to play with the child without the camera so they can get to know you and be relaxed.&nbsp; I try to interact with them for about five minutes, to set the mood for the session.&nbsp; When you start to shoot the child will figure it is all a part of playing together. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to let the child move &ndash; and be prepared to follow them.&nbsp; Containing them and looking for a &ldquo;pose&rdquo; or asking them to hold still is unnatural for them.&nbsp; Singing a song together that they know, playing &ldquo;Simon Says&rdquo;, having mom or dad doing silly dances behind you can all bring out giggles, smiles and cute expressions in the kids.&nbsp; Having a favorite toy such as a small wagon, a ball, a doll or teddy bear handy, can help focus the child&rsquo;s energies and attention. &nbsp;<br /><br />Toddlers look just as cute when they aren&rsquo;t looking at the camera, as when they do actually look at you.&nbsp; The goal is to capture the spirit of the moment, even if their eyes are looking somewhere else.&nbsp; A child looking away can have a twinkle in their eyes that shows wonder and innocence.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget the cute bits, like chubby thighs, baby feet and hands, wispy hair, and dimples. Their proportions and size are part of who they are at that phase in their life and unique to them.<br /><br />You need to be technically prepared when shooting with all kids, especially with perpetually moving toddlers.&nbsp; When shooting outdoors in morning light, start by using an 85mm lens at 2.8, 400 ASA and with a speed of 2000.&nbsp; Adjust from there depending on the light.&nbsp; In the images I show here there was quite a lot of ambient light and natural &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; light around, so I didn&rsquo;t need to use a flash, but in less than ideal lighting conditions a flash can be helpful. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br /><br />In three of the images I have used a grey slide in the playground.&nbsp; Kids naturally love slides and this playground is quite safe.&nbsp; I asked the parents to help the kids to the top of the slide and then I shoot from the bottom to capture the glee and excitement of the moment when they slide down.&nbsp; They will do this over and over and over &ndash; literally.&nbsp; Climbing and jumping are fun too and having the kids jump off the end of the slide which is only a few inches from the ground, gives a fun motion to the shots and animates them.&nbsp; When the child discovers a new playground toy or something to climb on it excites them and shows the real joy of childhood.&nbsp; Be ready and try to anticipate where they will go next and what they will try to do and position your self to get that action shot or cute expression.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}<br /><br />If you are shooting in a grassy area like a lawn, look for open shade.&nbsp; Be careful not to shoot looking way down on the child causing distortion.&nbsp; This might a good time to try singing and dancing as it gets the child to stay more in one place for a few minutes.&nbsp; If you are lucky enough to have a child actually sit still for a few minutes while you shoot, be ready with a toy or mom or dad behind you to bring out some genuine expressions.&nbsp; If the child isn&rsquo;t moving then their expressions are even more important to the shots.&nbsp; It will be over before you blink, so be ready.<br /><br />{attachment5}<br /><br />Shooting with toddlers and small kids can be challenging but the results can be magical and with the right approach you will have images that the parents will treasure forever.&nbsp; Be flexible, both in your manner of shooting and in your knees.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget they are little people trying to do big people things and get down to their eye level so that you won&rsquo;t only be capturing them but the world around them as they see it.&nbsp; If a shoot heads south, cut everyone some slack and try again another time.&nbsp; Each time toddlers and small kids shoot they will get more and more comfortable with you and the whole process, and begin to see you as a playmate and not shy away from you or your picture-taking.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-02 07:36:48','2015-04-05 12:57:24'),(197,63,' Team Creation with \"Tweens\" and Teens',NULL,'<p>It is great to be able to capture kids as they grow and change, and the kids themselves will love to see these images later in life when they have kids of their own. Shooting bigger kids can be a lot of fun as they will interact more with the photographer and become part of the team effort to have a successful shoot. Kids today are very used to taking pictures of themselves and their friends on their phones and are very comfortable with the process. They will often come up with great idea on their own and it is good to encourage them to share their suggestions with you &ndash; you never know what they might want to try that could be &ldquo;the shot&rdquo; of the shoot. Kids love to contribute ideas to the shoot and it makes it much for fun for them. If they are happy, the better the outcome will be.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Start by choosing a location where you can play with angles and elevations so the subject has somewhere to sit or lean. This avoids awkward body positions and strained expressions. If it feels natural for the kid then it will look natural.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>When choosing the look of the shoot that you will aim for, don&rsquo;t try to make the kid look different. With teenagers, let them express their own personal style with your direction. It is who they are at that moment and is authentic to them and how they want to be perceived. If they are sporty, let them move or show off a skill, such as dribbling a basketball, doing cartwheels or balancing on a skateboard. Be prepared for these sorts of action shots by choosing the correct speed and focal length. It is easier to fake a sportive action than to actually capture the magic action shot. For example, if you want to try a skateboarding shot, you can ask the kid to simply tilt back and forth while standing on the skateboard. If you aren&rsquo;t that used to action shots this is a quick way to get the feeling of movement without spending a lot of time repeating it over and over to get just the right shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Some girls love the &ldquo;model treatment&rdquo; and will view their photo shoot as if they are modeling. They will want a say in what they wear and how they look in the photos and the whole shoot can be very exciting for them. Never underestimate the &ldquo;fantasy factor&rdquo; where these girls are concerned. They will love all the attention paid to their hair and clothes. Keep any makeup to a minimum, and use simple things like lip balm and just curl the eyelashes rather than putting mascara on them. Use blotting papers instead of powder if the kid has a shiny face or gets sweaty while shooting. If they have any redness or pimples on their face use only the slightest amount of concealer as it might be very obvious in the final images. Use a little under the eyes if needed to cover dark circles. Don&rsquo;t let a kids obsess about the odd pimple or braces on the teeth. Both of these are normal and a part of who they are at that moment. You don&rsquo;t want them to be at all self-conscious.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Choose their attire to be very age appropriate. Don&rsquo;t age kids up &ndash; if they are eight years old, keep them eight years old. There is nothing cute about a kid or teen that looks way older than they actually are and it shows a lapse in judgment of the adults who did the images. Choose clothes that compliment their coloring and the background. Both boys and tomboys should be kept natural and dressed the way they normally dress. If you put kids and teens into very formal clothes and this goes against type, you will meet every sort of resistance and it is a sure fire way to have a fruitless photo shoot. Play to their strengths and you will keep their attention and actually bring out their true personality in images that all parties concerned will love now and in the future.</p>\r\n<p>When directing the subject, don&rsquo;t force smiles - it never makes for a pleasing image. It is good to shoot a mix of relaxed expressions mixed in with natural smiles. Telling jokes, asking them if they have a crush on anyone in particular, putting their favorite song on their phone and placing it near them, can all make them relax and giggle. Relaxed expressions are all about the eyes and they highlight the kid&rsquo;s facial structure as they are growing up. Comparing these types of expressions year after year in photos is really special for the parents and the kids, as they see their baby face become a big kid and then a teenager.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Take advantage of the opportunity to capture siblings together if the situation presents itself. Some siblings get along great and have no problem being photographed together while others will dig in their heels. Give it a good try, but know when to stop if that happens, or you will end up with a pile of pictures where only one kid looks good at a time, and both of them having stiff body language. Remember that when you have more than one subject in the image you need to be aware of all their facial expressions and positions at the same time. Shoot extra images to improve your chances of getting everyone looking good at the same time. Pay close attention to your composition so that the image looks balanced.</p>\r\n<p>One of the advantages of shooting digitally is that you have the option in post-production to turn a color image into black and white. This can give an image a timeless quality and reduce any distractions in the background, irregular or different skin tones, clashing colors in the clothing or even less than ideal weather conditions when shooting. Providing the parents with both color and black and white options will give them a wide variety of different images.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-02 07:40:02','2015-04-06 10:11:49'),(198,63,'Developing A Personal Style',NULL,'<p>At some point you will begin to develop your own photographic style and enjoy using your imagination to create the images you see in your mind.

From birthdays to graduations and everything in between, people are looking for photographers who have a unique perspective and will give them images that they can frame, use for holiday cards and albums.

Take note of locations that are available to you and what time of day the light will be best for shooting. Have the parents prepare the kid&rsquo;s clothes and accessories according to shoot plan.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2)</p>\r\n<p>In the first two image examples I show, I wanted to capture the ten-year-old girl in very classic images. I knew ahead of time that I would be converting the images into black and white and chose the clothes and accessories accordingly. I dressed her in a simple white cotton dress, suede boots, and left her hair naturally wavy. I added the flower garland in her hair to frame her face and draw attention to her eyes.</p>\r\n<p>I knew of an old, weathered playhouse that had a heart-shaped window, in the back of a friend&rsquo;s garden. I would look like we stepped into the past and it was the right scale and proportion for the girl. She brought her little white dog to the shoot, and voila, we had a great prop. I emulated the non-smiling expressions from the early days of photography, which gave my images the gentle, dreamy quality I wanted to achieve with the pictures. I shot four images in the series, which came out like a &ldquo;story&rdquo;. It was one of those moments in time where the parents knew that the girl was about to change into a pre-teen at any moment and it was wonderful to freeze that moment in time when she was still a little girl at play.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>The art direction was completely different for the third image of the boy sitting on the edge of the sidewalk. This boy was quite hip and modern so an urban setting suited him. We dressed him in clothes and accessories that stayed within a color palette range, that being greys and deep greens. We were in an urban area where there were many walls with graffiti, so we looked for one section, which would work well with his clothes. The graffiti gives an edgy, graphic look to the image and the gritty sidewalk gave him something to sit on. He visually pops out of the background. I had his parents joke with him while I was shooting and it really made him relax, and animated his eyes. His grin showed off his cute dimples when he smiled. He had natural gestures and expressions because he felt comfortable in the situation and in the environment. The images where he was being observed rather than smiling directly into the camera, rang much truer for the parents and didn&rsquo;t look contrived or unnatural.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Birthdays and rites of passage are documented now more than ever in photos. In the fourth image, it was the baby&rsquo;s first birthday. We kept the color scheme simple with a pink and white sheet on the grass, a pink cake on a white cake stand, and a pink tutu and party hat for the baby. Everything was to be soft and girly. We shot on the grass in a park where the baby would be safe if she tried to crawl off of the blanket. I wanted to show all her baby-chubby bits as she played with the tulle of the tutu. Lots of singing and clapping kept her attention so that she would look up and not just at the very interesting tutu.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>On one occasion I happened across this amazing black and white striped wall in bright sunlight. I knew I wanted to shoot something there and set about to art direct a shoot, which would be graphic and animated. I chose a seven-year-old girl who likes to dance, and I dressed her in a black dress, red sneakers, and red accessories. I kept her arms and legs bare, to keep the styling simple so she would pop out of the background. If she was wearing all black and white clothes she would have blended in to the background too much, I shot when the light was still quite high overhead but late enough that I would get shadows of her on the sidewalk. I had planned ahead of time that I would put three images together to show her movement. I wanted to capture her as she was lost in her own world, dancing along the sidewalk as only an unselfconscious child would do, so I asked her not to look at the camera.</p>\r\n<p>Having a limited color palette makes a stronger image, so consider this when conceptualizing and art directing your shoot. There will be times when things will be a riot of color and that can work too, so don&rsquo;t be afraid to go for it if the situation presents itself. If that happens, try to limit the distractions in the background and location. The idea behind these types of shoots is to be creative with your imagination and art direction, so that you can develop a distinct style over time. It can begin with an inspiring location, or something you saw in a magazine or online. It is important to plan and be prepared. If you do the shoot for your own practice then you are in fact the &ldquo;client&rdquo; with expectations.

Look for the fastest and biggest you can find.&nbsp; (Class 10 is a minimum speed)</li>\r\n<li>A card reader &ndash; even if your PC has a built-in card reader, it&rsquo;s good to have a spare option</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Tripod</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p>A good tripod is key. Hand-held video work just doesn&rsquo;t look professional unless it&rsquo;s really well done.&nbsp; While it is true that the cheapest tripod is still better than nothing, you really do need a proper fluid head for video work.&nbsp; A cheapie tripod with friction head, or worse a ball head for stills photography, just won&rsquo;t cut it.&nbsp; No tripod is ever fun to carry for long periods, so you need to find a balance between weight and sturdiness, and get a strap for it. I have had a Manfrotto with fluid motion head for many years and it can carry most prosumer camcorders and DSLRs.</p>\r\n<p>Tripods: Gitzo 1380 ($1,000), Manfrotto).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Microphones</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p>I could write a whole lesson on audio (oh wait, I did - Lesson 3!), but for now all you need to know is that good video is dependent upon good audio. It sounds paradoxical, but think about videos you watch - if you can\'t hear or understand the people speaking, or the audio levels keep changing, or there&rsquo;s a lot of background noise, that would be totally distracting &ndash; no matter how good the images look.</p>\r\n<p>There are three basic microphone types, which I\'ll outline here, and we\'ll delve more into what they do and how to use them in Lesson 3.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">On-camera mics</span>:&nbsp; These are omni-directional, meaning they capture all noise equally. If you are using the on-camera mic (which you NEVER should do, except in an absolute emergency), make sure that your environment is quiet, because it will pick up EVERYTHING.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wireless mics or lapel mics or lavaliere mics</span>: These are great for interviews or documentary work. They attach to your subject\'s clothing and lift their voice out for the environment. Their pick-up range is limited so they should be placed as close to the speaker\'s mouth as possible. The best part of a lapel mic or a wireless mic is you have the flexibility to move far away from your subjects and still be able to hear them. In order to use a lapel mic, your camera must have an input for an external mic. Serious videographers really should buy a camera with external mic capabilities.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:&nbsp; Sennheiser Evolution Wireless G2 ($750); Azden 100 LT wireless mic receiver and transmitter ($500) Sony&hellip;.<br />Shotgun mic (or uni-directional mic): Shotgun mics pick up sound primarily in the direction they are pointing. If you have the proper input on your camera a shotgun mic should ALWAYS be used in favor of the camera\'s internal mic.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">NOTE: With a shotgun, pay attention to the ambient sound directly behind your subject.</span></p>\r\n<p>Examples: Sennheiser ME-64 ($400) and ME-66 ($550); Rode NTG1 or NTG2 ($269); Rode VideoMic ($149 - For use with a camera that uses a 1/8\" mini-plug mic input).<br /><br /><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lights</span>:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lights also come in all shapes and sizes and really depend on your needs. If most of your filming will be in the field using a portable prosumer camera, then an LED panel that mounts to your camera or can be hand-held to one side will suffice. If you will be doing studio and interior production work, you may need to spend a bit more on lights. We\'ll talk about lighting more in Lesson 3. I reflector actually will get you pretty far without a light.</p>\r\n<p>Examples:&nbsp; On-camera light: Sony HVL-20DW2 ($87) LED light and panels</p>\r\n<p>Some more info on accessories:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VAleOhEbKA\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahyT-mNJi44</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>LESSON 1: PLANNING YOUR SHOOT<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Subjects:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Think about what subjects interest you.&nbsp; The best stories are the ones that find you, but if you don&rsquo;t have an immediate idea, you can follow the time-honored advice; look in your own back yard.&nbsp; No seriously, is there a lizard in your back yard?&nbsp; What does it eat?&nbsp; Does it have a mate?&nbsp; Do you have a dog with some interesting traits?&nbsp; Ok, just down the road from your home &ndash; any interesting characters?&nbsp; The town mechanic or barber or drugstore clerk no doubt has a few stories to tell.&nbsp; The city bus driver, cab driver, garbageman or doorman has some interesting experiences.&nbsp; Your grandma grew up in a different era and would no doubt be happy to get out the old photo albums and take a trip down memory lane.&nbsp; How about issues in your neighborhood?&nbsp; A documentary film can be a dispassionate &ldquo;documenting&rdquo; of a person, events or issue, or it can advocate for social change.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Access is king</strong>.&nbsp; Start out by making films about subjects you know and have access to.&nbsp; Wait till you have a few productions under your belt before tackling the more thorny issues like child trafficking, drugs or illegal gambling, those subjects are not for amateurs.</p>\r\n<p>What HAPPENS?</p>\r\n<p>Good documentary&nbsp;films are about people who do or did interesting things, who can talk about and show things.</p>\r\n<p>Other documentary films highlight a problem and show ways of dealing with it.&nbsp; In all cases, putting a human face on any issue will be the most successful route.&nbsp; Kevin Smith, former director of National Geographic Channel Asia, always said, &ldquo;Everyone wants to make environmental films, and no-one wants to watch them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Anchor your issue&nbsp;in&nbsp;a person whose life has been changed or is threatened by the circumstances you are talking about.</p>\r\n<p>A good, simple structure for a documentary film advocating for change is as follows:</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Here is a problem&nbsp;<br />(Example:&nbsp; The creek in the middle of town periodically overflows flooding homes built near it)</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>These are the people affected by it and how they are affected.</p>\r\n<p>(Introduce character whose house was washed away.&nbsp; Shots of flooded homes, archival images, photos from residents taken during previous incidents, a woman showing the ruined album of family photos.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>This is what has been done about it so far, and why more hasn&rsquo;t been done<br />(Disgruntled residents, defensive officials, dispassionate scientist)</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>This is what SHOULD be done about it, looking forward, how viewers can become&nbsp;involve</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Research:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The level of research you need to do depends on the type of piece you are producing. For all stories, you will need to:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Do a general search about the subject you are interested in, and make sure you have a good overview of the issues surrounding it.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Identify sources and reach out to them, explain what you want to do and ask if they are willing to be interviewed.&nbsp; People will usually be happy to talk about a subject that they&rsquo;re expert in, but be mindful of people&rsquo;s privacy, their biases, rivalries with other experts, etc.&nbsp; Half of documentary film production is people skills, politics, psychology.&nbsp; Also be aware that not all people, in fact, are thrilled about being asked to give up some of their valuable time to be interviewed (yet again) by some rookie.&nbsp; So do your homework and show that you&rsquo;ve grasped the essentials of the subject.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Figure out who your main characters are gong to be &ndash; who is likely to carry the piece?&nbsp; This should not be more than 2 or 3 people.&nbsp; There can be ancillary characters but viewers can not be expected to keep straight who does what if you keep on introducing new characters</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Sometimes someone who you didn&rsquo;t think was gong to be a primary character surprises you with a particularly engaging on-camera personality or unusual insight, so remain flexible enough to adapt.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Identify story themes. What message do you want your video to convey? You\'d be surprised how many people leave this to the filming and editing stage. Of course themes, plots and characters can change, but especially for complex stories it\'s imperative that you know what direction you want your story to take before filming.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the old adage of if you don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re gong, you definitely won&rsquo;t get there.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Figure out locations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Map out shot locations (visit your locations if possible, preferably during the time of day you will be filming to assess the light)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Determine and collect archival photos and video footage if necessary. NOTE: When conducting pre-interviews ask interview subjects if they have any photos, mementos or videos you can use.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>SUMMARIZE YOUR STORY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Before you begin filming, for all stories, no matter how complex, construct a brief, one-sentence story summary. If necessary, continuously refine this statement throughout the project. Some examples from my recent productions:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>An ordinary Taiwanese girl decides to become a &ldquo;betelnut girl for a day&rdquo; in order to gain personal insights into this controversial business and cultural phenomenon.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A Westerner from New Zealand marries an indigenous Taiwanese woman, and after participating in the bi-annual Pa Sta&rsquo;ay Festival, he finds himself accepted into the inner circle of the tribe.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>STORYBOARD</strong></p>\r\n<p>All videos can benefit from storyboarding, but it\'s especially necessary for the more complex pieces. Storyboarding can consist of anything from a rough story outline to a list of shots you need to get to detailed sketches of what those shots should look like. I\'m not very good at drawing so I don\'t do many sketches, but I do try to be as detailed as possible when mapping out my story. My storyboard template includes the following fields:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Sources:</strong>&nbsp;Who do you need to talk to? Have you contacted them yet? Did you conduct the interview? What were some of the highlights?&nbsp; Important story angles. Who agrees?&nbsp; Who disagrees?&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t show at least SOME of the other side of the story, your film will lack credibility and you will be seen as a shill.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Visual elements:</strong>&nbsp;(many shots will happen spontaneously, but identifying a few scene-setting ones to get will help anchor the piece). (Example:&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s get a low-angle shot with a waterproof camera of the houses by the creek, with brown water bubbling up and over the camera), and maybe a high-angle shot from a vantage point where we can see how the creek has changed course over recent years.).&nbsp; In particular, identify your establishing shots (more on this in lesson #2). If you can, think about how you want your edited piece to look. This will help in the field.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Graphics:</strong>&nbsp;This includes archival footage, photos, maps, charts, animations, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Timetable:</strong>&nbsp;I like to add deadline info into my storyboard matrix. This helps keep me on track.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The storyboard presented below is from a project I did a few years back comparing border security efforts in the two largest American cities on the U.S.-Mexico border (forgive the rough narration - I had to do the voice-over in a cheap hotel on the road and it sounds like I have a cold). As you can see below, my storyboards are more like project management templates than just a series of shot outlines.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The storyboard presented in Figure 3 above, is from a project I did a few years back comparing border security efforts in the two largest American cities on the U.S.-Mexico border (forgive the rough narration - I had to do the voice-over in a cheap hotel on the road and it sounds like I have a cold). As you can see below, my storyboards are more like project management templates than just a series of shot outlines.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>WRITING THE SCRIPT / TELLING THE STORY</strong></p>\r\n<p>Scripting is an art, because you are trying to coordinate still and moving images gathered from multiple sources with ambient sound and spoken word, all while conveying meaningful information. It\'s a bit like walking a tightrope backwards in high heels (okay, so it\'s not THAT difficult).&nbsp; Some basic tips for writing your script include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Every story needs a beginning, a middle and an end. If your video is just a bunch of sequences thrown together it will quickly lose focus. Your beginning should grab the viewer\'s attention, the middle should hold them, and the end should reward them for watching all the way through.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Write to your images. Videos are visually-driven, so you will need to tell your story in pictures, more so than in words.&nbsp; Having someone say &ldquo;Back in my day, women had to fight for their rights&rdquo; is much more compelling if accompanied by archive images of women with placards picketing and being manhandled by police.&nbsp;&nbsp; That said...</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If people at a gathering are clapping and cheering, don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;the people clapped and cheered.&rdquo;&nbsp; No really, I can SEE that!&nbsp; Rather say &ldquo;The couple received a warm welcome at every stop.&rdquo;&nbsp; That said...</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Refer to your images. Audio and video should work in concert, so if you are filming a surgery, as the knife goes in you can say, \"A small incision reduces scarring and makes for a shorter recovery time.\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Synchronize the audio with the video. If you say, \"Even former president Bill Clinton showed up to lend support,\" you should see Bill Clinton the moment you say his name.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Write in the active voice and the appropriate tense in relation to the viewer.&nbsp; Be careful about time references.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;Next week&rdquo; or &ldquo;last week&rdquo; if the film will be released after that time.&nbsp; Rather use words like &ldquo;Soon, we will &hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;Just recently, we &hellip;&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Write conversationally, how you would talk, and avoid jargon words that only the people in the film will understand.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t be condescending either.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;Using his trusty thingamabob, the astrophysicist traces the arc of the Whatzawoozle&rdquo;. Better to say &ldquo;Tracing the arc of the Whatzawoozle, or super-sized asteroid, is important to our planet&rsquo;s continued existence.&nbsp; Fortunately, Astrophycisist John Brown has devised a tracking device, which he calls a Thingamambob, that can give us early warning of any heavenly bodies coming uncomfortably close.&rdquo;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Find your voice, it\'s the best way to communicate in the end.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don\'t write in clich&eacute;s (unless that\'s how you talk)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t stray from your central theme. Purposeful deviations to amplify or add color to the central theme are okay, but it should eventually be clear to the viewer why every line and every image were included.</li>\r\n</ul>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-06 13:16:57','2015-04-06 13:16:57'),(200,64,'Clean Audio and Effective Lighting',NULL,'<p>I have stressed the importance of audio in previous lessons, but in Lesson #3 I will show you how to properly record audio so that you get clear, clean sound.

Wear your headphones:</strong> If there were a &ldquo;10 Commandments for Video&rdquo;, this would be at the top, possibly right behind &lsquo;Take off the lens cap.\' As I mentioned in Lesson #2, I\'ve been burned by assuming that my audio was good and then noticing later that there was static in the audio channel which made the interview useless. While there are a few things you can do in post production to mitigate the damage of bad audio, there is no magic potion fix it. It\'s best just to get it right in the first place.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Check your levels:</strong> If you have a camera that allows you to monitor your microphone levels you should always turn that function on (see below). Your levels should JUST be occasionally touching&nbsp; the red line at the end of the bar. If it stays there it will cause annoying popping sounds or crunching audio that you will not be able to fix. Audio should always peak around -12Db, which is a standard setting on all audio level indicators.</p>\r\n<p>If your camera allows you to manually control your audio you should use it - the auto levels often don\'t adjust very well to loud environments, and have an annoying habit of raising the levels (and thus, hiss) during quiet moments, and then being a bit slow on adjusting when speech starts again, causing an annoying and unprofessional &ldquo;pumping&rdquo; of the audio levels.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Collect lots of natural/ambient sound:</strong> The sound of a river flowing, the roar of a crowd, the honking and vrooming of rush hour traffic. Make sure you record plenty of these &lsquo;ambient\' sounds.&nbsp; I always record my shot for 5-10 seconds before calling for action, and keep recording for 5-10 seconds after, to ensure that I have plenty of &lsquo;filler sound.\' This can come in handy during editing if I need to edit two shots together and the second shot has bad audio. I can just erase the bad audio and extend the good audio from the first shot. Trust me, this will become an invaluable technique during your long production career. (TIP: Make sure that when you are recording natural sound that no one is talking in the background. This often happens when I go out on shoots with other people and they think that just because the action is not happening they can talk).</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Ten seconds of \"silence\":</strong> The word silence in this situation is somewhat of a misnomer, as there\'s no such thing as absolute silence in a recording situation. Every location has its own tone, whether you\'re in a large warehouse or a small studio apartment. And when you change locations so does the sound. I like to record at least 15 seconds of the closest thing to silence I can get. Similar to natural sound, you\'ll use this silence in the editing process to mask changes in the background levels from one shot to the next</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Get close:</strong> Get the mic as close to the sound source as possible (however, make sure it\'s not too close or you will blow out your audio levels which will result in annoying popping sounds). Clear, crisp sounds like the sound of meat cooking at a restaurant or a broom sweeping in preparation of big event are just as compelling as strong visuals, and can connect the viewer to the moment even better than images. (SEE THE ASSIGNMENT FOR A LINK TO AN EXCELLENT SERIES OF VIDEOS WITH GREAT SOUND).</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Stop and listen:</strong> The first thing you should do in any new environment is put on your headphones and just listen. Think about what you want to record. Do you hear any weird buzzes or blips? Is an air conditioner or heater on, or a radio playing in the background? Do what you can to fix audio impurities (see trouble shooting below).</p>\r\n<p><strong>7. Use a wind screen:</strong> If you are recording outside make sure you have a wind screen. There\'s nothing worse than the &lsquo;whoosh\' of wind drowning out your subject, unless you\'re covering a storm and the sound is important to the storytelling experience. If you don\'t have a windscreen on your mic you can improvise. Sometimes I\'ll tie extra socks or cotton hats over my shotgun mic, and you should always be able to tuck a lapel mic into your subject\'s shirt or jacket. If you are using the on-camera mic, you can wrap some cloth over the mic inputs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>TROUBLE-SHOOTING BAD AUDIO:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Buzz/hum:</strong> Most likely caused by interference with other electronics, radio frequencies or the camera\'s internal parts. Identify and turn off all electronic equipment in the room, including computers, and get to know where the motors are on your camera so you can recognize when a mic will catch that noise.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Hiss:</strong> Most likely from a faulty mic or a bad connection between the mic and the camera. Isolate the problem by trying out different mics or the same mic on a different camera.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Loud background noise:</strong> If you\'re in an environment that\'s noisy like a restaurant or a busy street, you\'ll need to make sure the microphone is very close to your subject\'s mouth. If your audio gets overwhelmed by the background noise, you can move mic closer to the subject, reposition your subject, ask nicely for loud noise-offenders to be quiet or, if all else fails, change locations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Rustling:</strong> The mic is hitting the subject\'s clothing. Put the lapel mic in an area that won\'t get caught up in the subject\'s tie, collar, hair, etc. Alternatively, it could be wind rustling. Use a windscreen or change locations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Clicks:</strong> Mic picks up an electrical current from another source. This often happens around refrigerators, computers, air conditioners and powerlines. Isolate the source and see if you can turn it off, or change locations.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Popping:</strong> The mic is too close to the source and the audio levels are peaking. Turn down levels or place the mic farther from the subject\'s mouth.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fixing in post:</strong></p>\r\n<p>The most common audio problem is &ldquo;hiss&rdquo;, or &ldquo;hum&rdquo; caused by air conditioners of sometimes even just by cameras&rsquo; internal circuitry.&nbsp; If you have sound that has already been recorded and you need to fix some steady background noise, the audio software like Audacity (Free download at <a href=\"http://audacity.sourceforge.net%20\">http://audacity.sourceforge.net </a>) can help you out.</p>\r\n<p>This will mean you need to separate the audio from the video.&nbsp; Usually you can do this in your video editing software &ndash; just output the video clip as a .wav audio file.</p>\r\n<p>Once you import your audio file into Audacity, you:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Select Effect &gt; Noise Removal</li>\r\n<li>Select a small piece of audio that has ONLY the noise you want to remove.</li>\r\n<li>Click Get Noise Profile</li>\r\n<li>Select the entire piece of audio</li>\r\n<li>Click OK to start noise removal process</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Once you have your audio file saved, you&rsquo;ll need to pull it back into your video editor and sync it up, and re-render as a video file with the fixed audio.&nbsp; This is a pretty cumbersome process which will remind you to get it right at the recording stage!</p>\r\n<p>This is a somewhat advanced but very useful piece on microphones and audio.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://cdn.shure.com/publication/upload/403/us_pro_audiovideoproduction_ea.pdf\">http://cdn.shure.com/publication/upload/403/us_pro_audiovideoproduction_ea.pdf</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>RECORDING VOICE-OVERS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Your footage is shot and logged and your script is a work of art. Now it\'s time to record the voice over. It takes practice to get comfortable with voice work.&nbsp; Here is a useful introduction to voiceover work:&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKgXy22XejA\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKgXy22XejA</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>SIX TIPS TO IMPROVE YOUR VOICE-OVERS:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1</strong>. <strong>Underline words that need emphasis:</strong> Before I actually record the voice over, I always read through the script and get a feel for which words should be emphasized. I underline those words so that I know to give them a bit of oomph when I come across them in the script.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Write short, declarative sentences:</strong> One scripts I&rsquo;ve seen actually had this line in it: \"In Obama\'s case, the 100-day benchmark provides an opportunity to tie up some important questions left unanswered from his historic presidential campaign - and to assess a burst of early activity unrivaled since the early 1930s when Franklin Delano Roosevelt tackled the Great Depression in his first 100 days in office.\" Halfway through that sentence, you&rsquo;re left gasping for breath, and meaning has been lost.&nbsp; So take a look and see how you would rewrite that sentence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I would say something as follows:&nbsp; \"The first 100 days in office is a milestone for any president, and Obama now has the opportunity to tie up some important questions left unanswered from his historic presidential campaign.&nbsp; He may also assess a burst of early activity, unrivaled since the early 1930s when Roosevelt tackled the Great Depression in his first 100 days in office.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Choose your recording location carefully:</strong> The space you record in is extremely important. If possible, record in a small room away from outside noises and covered in soundproof foam or heavy padding. You can get really creative by making a &ldquo;tent&rdquo; of heavy blankets, pillows or jackets around the microphone. Basically use anything made of foam or cloth to absorb the sound bouncing off smooth walls, etc. which cause a &ldquo;tinny&rdquo; or &ldquo;spacey&rdquo; effect. <br />Here&rsquo;s a good summary on different kinds of microphones:&nbsp;<a href=\"%20http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiVbW4Z2T4\"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2CiVbW4Z2T4<br /></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Get excited and use your hands:</strong> I\'ve found that if I make gestures with my hands while I\'m recording a voiceover my entire tone is much more energetic. Speak like you\'re explaining something really cool to a good friend. If you\'re not animated about what you\'re explaining your audience won\'t be either.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. Speak naturally:</strong> You don\'t want to sound like you are reading and you don\'t want to shout. Don\'t assume \"Broadcaster Voice\" - it will sound too stiff and forced without any prior practice. I just like use my naturally voice, making sure not to mumble.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Listen to others - and then practice:</strong> One of the best ways to get comfortable with the rhythm and feel of voiceovers is to listen to how your favorite TV and radio personalities do it. Pick a few people whose work you really admire and study their tone, inflection, rhythm and pacing. Then practice doing your own. You can start by mimicking them, and eventually you\'ll come up with your own style.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOW TO CONDUCT INTERVIEWS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>I\'m including this tutorial in the audio section, but interviews involve much more than just getting good sound. I\'ll also discuss how to prepare for interviews, how to frame questions that get good responses for video and proper framing and composition. If you are not producing a news or documentary video, this section will still be valuable to you for insight on how to frame people. We\'ll discuss lighting, and lighting people in particular, in the next section.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1. Preparation/set up:</strong> Know what questions you are going to ask, and, just as important, how you are going to ask them. Video interview questions need to be structured so that the interviewee answers in complete sentences. Fragments won\'t work. Get to the interview early so you can set up and frame the right background.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Use open-ended questions:</strong> You want the subject to include the question as part of the answer. Don\'t ask &lsquo;yes\' or &lsquo;no\' questions like \"are you happy with the outcome of today\'s election?\", but rather, \"what does the outcome of today\'s election mean to you?\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Avoid multi-part questions:</strong> Questions should be simple and to the point. When you ask two-part questions, the first question almost never gets answered.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Description is key:</strong> You want your subject to provide all of the detail. Use &lsquo;describe this\' and &lsquo;give me a sense of\' and &lsquo;tell me about what it was like,\' when asking your questions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>External noise:</strong> Try to eliminate as much ambient noise as possible. If you are outside be wary of wind (this is why you need to wear headphones).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>2. Conducting the interview:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Ease in to the interview:</strong> You need your subject to be completely comfortable with you and with being filmed. Set up the camera but don\'t even begin recording until you\'re sure the subject is at ease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Ask, then shut up:</strong> During the interview, it\'s critical that you ask your questions and then be quiet. Don\'t interject &lsquo;uh-huh\' and &lsquo;right\' or you\'ll hate yourself when you go back to edit. Allow the subject to answer completely and wait a second or two before your next question and your follow-up.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Don\'t be afraid of silence:</strong> Ask your question, and if you don\'t like the answer stay silent for a few more seconds and see if they offer an explanation or a clarification. Usually these secondary answers are better and more honest than the first.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Listen, and ask follow up questions:</strong> It\'s easy to get distracted by all of the technical elements of conducting an on camera interview. But don\'t forget to really listen to the answers and see if you hear anything unexpected or surprising. The more of these interviews you conduct the more comfortable you\'ll be with the equipment and then you\'ll really be able to focus on the interview.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Final question:</strong> Always ask, is there something I didn\'t ask you that you think would be important to mention?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Keep the camera rolling:</strong> Even when the interview is over, keep the camera rolling and engage in a conversation about some of the things you heard in an interview. With the formal interview over the subject will be more relaxed and will often provide clearer and more interesting quotes (of course make sure that they know the camera is still rolling and that you are still talking on the record).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Here is Katie Couric on interview techniques:&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eOynrI2eTM\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eOynrI2eTM</a></p>\r\n<p>And a slightly more flashy type:&nbsp;<a href=\"%20http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCK7i1ecSLA\"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCK7i1ecSLA<br /></a></p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Composing the interview:</strong> There are two ways to compose an interview. One captures just the subject while the interviewer asks questions off camera. The other captures both the interviewer and the interviewee/s.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Invisible interviewer</em></strong>. Perfect for documentaries, interview or analysis pieces.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Place your subject in a well-lit or artificially lit setting.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Be mindful of backgrounds (don\'t have any potted plants coming out of their head).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Have the interviewer stand directly opposite of the interviewee so they are looking each other in the eye. Set the camera up just to the left or right of the interviewer. Tell the subject to look at the interviewer and not the camera.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Place the camera at the interviewee\'s eye level or slightly above eye level.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Frame the shot so that the interviewee\'s head and just above the shoulders fill the left or right third of the frame, as demonstrated below. In other words, lead the look (Remember this rule of composition from lesson #2?). If the subject does not fill up enough of the frame they will look small and awkward.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It\'s okay to change perspective halfway through the interview, or multiple times throughout the interview. Move the camera to the other side of the interviewer, zoom in, zoom out, etc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>When conducting multiple interviews for a piece, be sure to switch up perspective between interviews. Place subjects with opposing viewpoints on opposite sides of the frame so if you cut between them it appears they are having a debate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If you are interviewing someone who practices an interesting hobby or profession, then include some of their paraphernalia or working environment, and if possible, let them continue doing what they do, while speaking.&nbsp; People usually relax and speak more naturally if their hands are busy with a familiar task.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><br /><strong>Two-person (or more) interviews.</strong> You know, like 60 minutes. Ideally you will use two cameras (or more) for this type of interview, but you can use one and shoot the interviewer asking the questions separately. Just be sure to shoot so that in the editing process you can make it appear as if you had two cameras the whole time.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Match eye-lines: Make sure the eyes of the interviewee and the interviewer are on the same plane in the frame.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Lead the look on both subjects</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Audio:</strong>&nbsp; Again, recording impromptu interviews is fraught with sound issues, especially when recording someone working in a noisy environment like a factory.&nbsp; Often, in field situations, the only thing you can do is take your subject around the corner, away from the source of noises, and to get the microphone as close as possible to their mouth.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>LIGHTING:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Lighting of course is a very important but pretty technical aspect of video production. Like audio, great lighting can elevate a decent video to another level, and bad lighting can ruin even the best storyline. That said, my general feeling about lighting is that if it looks good, it is good, and that there\'s no reason to go to extremes to create professional studio-quality lighting. One could spend hundreds, even thousands of dollars on professional lighting equipment, and for some productions that\'s necessary. But for low-or-no budget operations, there are plenty of ways to get decent enough lighting that will serve you well in 95% of your filming situations.</p>\r\n<p>First, let\'s learn some key terms about lighting that will help us as we explain potential light sources:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Three point lighting:</strong> The most basic lighting set up and the one you will use most often. The subject is lit by three different sources (see below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Key light:</em></strong> The key light is the primary light source in a scene where the filmmaker wants a person or an object to be illuminated. It\'s always the brightest light, and sometimes it\'s the only light source you will need. For interviews I will usually just set up one key light directly in front of the subject, and put the camera next to the light. This set up lights the subject\'s face evenly so the nose or eye sockets don\'t cast any shadows on the rest of the face. As long as the subject is lit so that the features you want to emphasize are illuminated and there are no unintended shadows, then you\'re in good shape. The best key light is the sun, although direct sunlight is too harsh and will require a fill light.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Fill light:</em></strong> A fill light is usually softer than a key light and can soften shadows cast by the key light. It\'s usually placed at a 45-degree angle opposite the key light and at a slightly lower position. In direct sunlight, a reflector can be used as a fill light - it will reflect the sun rays back on to the subject and fill in the shadows.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong><em>Back light:</em></strong> A light source behind a subject that gives it a bit of a glow and makes it appear three-dimensional. This is especially good when the subject and the background have similar colors or tones and you want to separate the two.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Fortunately, there are plenty of very useful lighting tutorials available online, which you can reference. </em></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcMX1RcNRYA%20&ndash;%20Video%20Lighting%20Basics%20&ndash;%203%20lights%20http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAbSn7VkhmY%20One-light%20setup\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcMX1RcNRYA</a> &ndash; Video Lighting Basics &ndash; 3 lights</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcMX1RcNRYA%20&ndash;%20Video%20Lighting%20Basics%20&ndash;%203%20lights%20http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAbSn7VkhmY%20One-light%20setup\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAbSn7VkhmY </a>One-light setup</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>LIGHTING TIPS:</strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp; Whenever possible, use natural light. I HATE setting up lights, so over the years I\'ve made good use of the sun. That big yellow ball of gas is a great key light, and it\'s free. Whenever I can, I do interviews outside in the daylight, or I place my subject with my back to a window so that the light shines in on them (NOTE: Never place your subject in front of the window or the camera will expose for the background leaving your subject dark and underexposed). The best time to shoot outdoors is during the early morning and in the evening when the sun has a nice golden light. If you must film in the middle of the day, try to shoot in shade. Place your subject so that their face is lit with no shadows, and make sure the background isn\'t in sunlight or you\'ll have the same problems I noted above (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0JGQ-rftXo\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0JGQ-rftXo</a>:&nbsp; Using natural light.)</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong> Use a reflector or a scrim. If you have to shoot outdoors in harsh daylight, it\'s worth it to buy a reflector or a scrim. Place your subject so that the sun is at a 45-degree angle on their face. That side will be well lit - too well lit, in fact, and will cast shadows on the other side of the face - so place the reflector on the opposite side. If you hold the reflector high, the reflected light will look more natural than holding it below eye-level.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">A reflector bounces light off a shiny surface and fills in the shadows caused by harsh sunlight.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Scrims block light from coming through, which can be handy if the sun is too strong and you want to create your own shadow.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Be mindful of light continuity. One of the biggest problems with shooting outdoors is that the sun is constantly moving and that the angle and color of the light are constantly changing. So make sure that you shoot all of your shots for a particular scene in similar lighting conditions. For longer-term projects this may mean shooting scenes over the course of a few days.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Manually set your white balance. As we mentioned in lesson #1, white balance tells your camera what true white should look like. Different light sources use different ends of the color spectrum. Video shot with incandescent lighting will tend to have a yellow/orange cast, and video shot under fluorescent lighting will have a bluish (sometimes green) cast. Outside, early morning light has a golden hue, light under cloudy skies has a bluish hue and light in the middle of the day is a harsh white. If you don\'t set white balance, your camera might not know to compensate for these various scenarios and will throw all of your other colors off as well.</p>',21,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-06 13:31:22','2015-04-07 09:24:43'),(201,64,'Putting It All Together',NULL,'<p>So here you are - you have crafted your epic story, taking into account all of the various shots and characters you will need; you have filmed breathtaking footage worthy of an Oscar; your audio will dazzle in the theater\'s 5.1 Dolby surround sound and the lighting is heavenly.

Of all the elements involved in producing a video, editing can take a good 40-50% of the time. Sometimes even more. Which makes this lesson one of the most important of the course. Over the next few pages, I\'m not going to teach you how to use your editing software - there are way too many editing programs out there to even begin to go that route - but rather how to turn a few hours of footage into a well-crafted, complete story. This lesson will be less technical than the previous three, but will nevertheless tackle some complex concepts.</p>\r\n<p>Look at these:&nbsp;<a href=\"%20http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1mOH1UpNdM\"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1mOH1UpNdM</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>EDITING PHILOSOPHY:</strong></p>\r\n<p>I want to begin this lesson with some thoughts on editing theory. In my mind the word editing - as it relates to video - has two meanings. First, there\'s the literal meaning, the physical act of connecting multiple visual and audio elements together to form a scene. This definition is rather clinical, but it helps to keep in mind that the building blocks of editing are the juxtaposition of two or more images to form a meaning greater than each image by itself.</p>\r\n<p>But then there\'s the philosophical meaning of the word. Editing as the subjective process an editor goes through to determine how to best convey the message he or she is trying to communicate. This definition is much more emotional, and uses the power of visuals and sound to articulate that emotion to viewers. Video is an emotional medium. For film or commercial editors, there are a nearly limitless number of ways an editor can create an emotional connection with the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>As a video documentarian, my goal in the editing process is to bring out the emotion in my material without being sensational or manipulative. This isn\'t always easy, but it is something that every documentarian must be cognitive of while editing. Feature or commercial film editors may have different goals. In fact, many of these types of productions may be purposefully manipulative as the editor works to get the viewer to feel a certain way.</p>\r\n<p>There are few techniques to keep in mind as you are editing your project that will determine the overall look and feel of your piece. Let\'s take a look at some of them.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>STORY ARC:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Gustav Freytag was a 19th century German novelist who excelled as a dramatic theorist. He was a student of Greek literature and Shakespeare, and based on his studies developed a theory of dramatic plot structure that today represents the foundation of basic storytelling. \"Freytag\'s Pyramid,\" as it\'s now known, stipulates that drama has five stages, as seen in the figure below.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1.</strong> Exposition, the background information needed to properly understand the story, including the main characters, the setting and the basic conflict</p>\r\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Rising action, introduces complications or obstacles to the character\'s pursuit of resolving his/her/their conflict</p>\r\n<p><strong> 3.</strong> Climax, the turning point, where things change for the better or the worse for the character/s</p>\r\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Falling action, the conflict unravels and we feel we are headed for... 5. Resolution, the conflict is resolved (this isn\'t always a good thing for the main character/s - sometimes the resolution is bad).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>You can still find plenty of examples of the dramatic plot structure in stories today. A great example is Washington Post videojournalist Travis Fox\'s \"<a href=\"https://vimeo.com/1327265\">Who Shot Mahamat Ali</a>.\". The story starts at a hospital in southeastern Chad with a refugee named Mahamat Ali. We get exposition - we meet Ali and learn that he has been shot, a victim of violence spilling over from neighboring Darfur. Then we get the rising action - Ali and the narrator go on a journey to find the man who shot Ali. At each stop they keep coming up empty. Climax - we meet Osman Terrap, the man Ali says shot him. Falling action - the \"trial\" of Osman Terrap, and the resolution, Terrap is acquitted by other Arab leaders, but we realize that in such a complicated environment there\'s no way to easily tell who are the victims and who are the perpetrators.</p>\r\n<p>Of all the elements of the dramatic structure, rising action is the most important. Fox builds the rising action slowly, and it consumes a majority of the narrative. Think of how differently the story would have turned out if Fox spent more time on exposition, and only got to the search for Osman Terrap with 2-3 minutes left. Or if the rising action was really short and most of the video consisted of a bunch of tribal leaders sitting around talking about what should happen to Terrap. While most of the framing of the dramatic structure happens during the storyboarding and scripting phases, the editor does have control over how a story unfolds.</p>\r\n<p>Of course the dramatic structure comes in many shapes and sizes, and there is plenty of room for creativity. Not all stories are told most effectively in a linear fashion, and as the editor it is up to you to determine the order in which information is revealed to the audience and how they are told it. You should know the chronological order to your story\'s events, and then figure out the most effective way to assemble the pieces.</p>\r\n<p>And one final note on this: Even if you are not interested in producing a traditional story, but rather a commercial, promotional or educational video, the dramatic structure can still be of great use. The reason that it has endured for so long is because it is almost scientific in guaranteeing engagement - and what is the point of video if not to engage your audience? So even if your end purpose is to teach your audience how a bill becomes a law, consider how such a production would play out in the dramatic structure. You could use the rising action to draw out the suspense by illustrating all of the myriad ways a bill can fail before it can ever be signed by the president (or the prime minister/king), depending on your country\'s style of government).</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>PACING:</strong></p>\r\n<p>An editor\'s most effective tool is pacing. The editor controls the rhythm of the story, and should be conscious of when the story needs to slow down and when it needs to speed up. Visual stories are quite similar to written stories in this way. William Faulkner used long, run-on sentences to give a meandering, languid feel to his prose, while Ernest Hemingway used short, staccato sentences to keep his narrative moving. And of course both of them, like all good writers, varied their sentence and paragraph lengths to fit the tone of the particular moment.</p>\r\n<p>In video, stories that are complex or technical should have a fairly moderate pace, especially when lots of numbers or statistics are being thrown out (although the careful producer will never introduce more than one number every 5 seconds). Slowed-down editing can also be a very powerful tool for heightening the drama of an emotional or particularly powerful scene. Most stories tend to proceed at a moderate to fast pace, changing shots every 2-5 seconds to keep the story moving. This is why shooting in sequences in the field is so important, because you can cut every scene into wide-medium-tight and keep showing what is essentially the same shot from different perspectives.</p>\r\n<p>A mix of fast and slow can be very effective. For a <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/13116042\">natural sound piece</a> on Barack Obama\'s inauguration, music is used to help guide the pace. It starts slow, with the opening shot focusing on a red blinking light. But once the music kicks in the pace picks up using time-lapse to show the thousands of people arriving to the National Mall for the big event. And later, when Obama is speaking, things slow down again and focus on the faces of those in crowd. Finally, near the end of his speech, the music is dropped so that you only hear the natural sound, heightening the emotional tension of the moment.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>TRANSITIONS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Transitions are one of the more commonly misused editing tools (I have even been known to get a transition wrong now and then). There are three fundamental types of transitions, and they can be quite effective when used properly.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Dissolves.</strong></em> A dissolve is when one shot blends into the next. Dissolves usually represent the passage of time between two related, or at least tangentially related, shots. For example, in the first video below, dissolves are used to show a woman walking a long distance in a relatively short amount of time. By slowly dissolving from one shot to the next we can illustrate her movement without having to have her walk in and out of each shot, which would take up a considerable amount of time. Dissolves also help create a mood or a feel, and in this situation the dissolve has the added effect of conveying the woman\'s state by creating a hazy, disoriented feel. We might also want to use a dissolve to introduce a flashback or a flash-forward scene, although we\'ll need to give other visual cues of time passage such as change of environment, clothes or appearance.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Cuts.</strong></em> A simple cut is my favorite kind of transition and can (and should) be used in most situations. A cut is when one shot follows another with no effects whatsoever. It\'s used when time passage is not an issue, or at least when the editor doesn\'t want to draw attention to the passage of time. A dialogue will cut back and forth between the two characters. A chase scene will involve rapid cuts, with the pacing and rhythm increasing as the chase reaches its climax. A sequence is simply wide-medium-tight shots cutting back and forth between one another, although not always in that particular order. Cuts are effective because they don\'t draw attention to the transition and can provide detail or context at the just the right moment without the viewer ever noticing. In fact, because cuts are so simple, many beginner editors feel that the straight cut is too basic and that it doesn\'t give them enough opportunity to show off their editing skills. For an example of cuts, watch the second video below, which you\'ll remember as the \"Wide-Medium-Tight\" example from Lesson 2.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Fades.</strong></em> A fade-to-black is a more advanced transition, and should be used very rarely. While a cut is like a period, and a dissolve is like a paragraph break, I consider a fade similar to a chapter break. Unless your piece is highly stylized, in which case most traditional rules go out the window, you should only use fades when you want to make a clear, thematic transition. As Karel Reisz writes in the excellent editing tome \"The Technique of Film Editing,\" \"a fade expresses a more pronounced pause in the continuity: it breaks the narrative flow and seals off the action which preceded from the action that follows.\" I couldn\'t have said it better myself. The third video below shows an example of a conventional fade.</p>\r\n<p>In summary, when considering what transition to use, ask yourself if there is either a stylistic or plot-driven purpose for using a dissolve or a fade. If there\'s not, stick with a straight cut.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>EFFECTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Even more than transitions, effects should be used with great care in video. Nothing is worse than being taken out of the flow of a story because of a distracting effect. Cheesy effects in particular, such as digitally generated explosions, flames, lasers, light flares, glows or transition that fold the image up like a paper plane and makes it fly away - anything else that would make your viewers\' eyes pop out of their head, should be avoided at all costs (unless you\'re going for a bad sci-fi movie parody). Of course, some effects are more common than others and, when used properly, can be an acceptable enhancement. Let\'s discuss a few of those.</p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Moving still images, or the Ken Burns Effect: </em></strong> Moving on a still image is an effect that is so widely accepted it even has its own name. The Ken Burns Effect is named after the American documentary filmmaker who pioneered the technique for his epic tomes on Jazz, Baseball, World War II and the American Civil War (my favorite example of the Ken Burns effect is a <a href=\"Moving%20still%20images,%20or%20the%20Ken%20Burns%20Effect Moving%20on%20a%20still%20image%20is%20an%20effect%20that%20is%20so%20widely%20accepted%20it%20even%20has%20its%20own%20name.%20The%20Ken%20Burns%20Effect%20is%20named%20after%20the%20American%20documentary%20filmmaker%20who%20pioneered%20the%20technique%20for%20his%20epic%20tomes%20on%20Jazz,%20Baseball,%20World%20War%20II%20and%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%20(my%20favorite%20example%20of%20the%20Ken%20Burns%20effect%20is%20a%20video%20that%20uses%20the%20technique%20on%20a%20bunch%20of%20photos%20of%20Ken%20Burns%20himself.%20The%20effect%20is%20when%20you%20give%20movement%20to%20an%20image%20by%20panning%20from%20one%20point%20to%20another,%20or%20zooming%20in%20or%20out%20on%20a%20particular%20spot.%20Many%20low-end%20editing%20software%20programs%20like%20iMovie,%20Windows%20Movie%20Maker%20and%20Pinnacle%20Studio%20have%20built-in%20Ken%20Burns%20Effect%20options.%20My%20advice%20for%20using%20this%20technique%20comes%20from%20the%20master%20himself%20-%20Ken%20Burns%20suggests%20that%20if%20you%20are%20going%20to%20move%20a%20still%20image,%20have%20a%20reason%20for%20moving%20it.%20What%20are%20you%20trying%20to%20say?%20Do%20you%20want%20to%20reveal%20a%20part%20of%20an%20image%20at%20a%20particular%20point%20in%20the%20script%20by%20doing%20a%20reverse%20zoom,%20or%20do%20you%20want%20to%20scan%20across%20the%20faces%20of%20a%20group%20of%20people%20in%20a%20static%20image?%20However%20you%20decide%20to%20use%20the%20effect,%20just%20make%20sure%20that%20you%20can%20justify%20it.%20Movement%20for%20movement\'s%20sake%20can%20be%20distracting.%20Some%20of%20the%20worst%20videos%20I\'ve%20ever%20seen%20just%20have%20randomly%20generated%20Ken%20Burns%20effects%20that%20move%20for%20no%20apparent%20reason.\">video</a> that uses the technique on a bunch of photos of Ken Burns himself. The effect is when you give movement to an image by panning from one point to another, or zooming in or out on a particular spot. Many low-end editing software programs like iMovie, Windows Movie Maker and Pinnacle Studio have built-in Ken Burns Effect options. My advice for using this technique comes from the master himself - Ken Burns suggests that if you are going to move a still image, have a reason for moving it. What are you trying to say? Do you want to reveal a part of an image at a particular point in the script by doing a reverse zoom, or do you want to scan across the faces of a group of people in a static image? However you decide to use the effect, just make sure that you can justify it. Movement for movement\'s sake can be distracting. Some of the worst videos I\'ve ever seen just have randomly generated Ken Burns effects that move for no apparent reason.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Split screen:</strong></em>  The split screen is effective for juxtaposing two images on the screen at the same time, or connecting two otherwise disparate shots together. It\'s an easy effect to produce - you just reduce the size of each video track to around 50% and place them next to each other. Of course, one image can be larger than other, or you can place multiple images on the screen at once. It\'s a fun technique to play around with and can be very effective if you want to convey lots of visual information at once. The next image below (or a view of the original <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/13116042\">here</a>) is from a video during Barack Obama\'s inauguration. It used split screen of different shots of people arriving to the National Mall to illustrate the true magnitude of the event.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Fast or slow motion :</strong></em> The video linked above also shows how slow and fast motion can be used to accentuate a particular scene or create a feel. The blinking red light is slowed down to the beat of the music to create a sort of calm-before-the-storm feeling. Then, once the music picks up, the video kicks into fast motion to show the sheer volume of people coming to the inauguration. The very first video example in this lesson is also a good example of how altering the speed of a clip can affect its overall rhythm and feel. The slowed down shots of the woman, in concert with the dissolves, gives a sense of disorientation and confusion. Be judicious with both of these effects. Slow motion can be clich&eacute;, and time lapse (fast motion) can feel gimmicky. Again, only use them if there is a compelling narrative justification to do so.<br />Top 5 Editing Tips:&nbsp;<a href=\"%20http:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0sK0X5Io0\"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0sK0X5Io0</a></p>',21,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-06 13:33:37','2015-04-07 09:27:00'),(202,64,'The Visual Story: Camera Work and Compostion',NULL,'<p>In this lesson you are going to learn how to properly shoot video, including basic rules of composition and cinematography, surefire tips for efficient and effective filming, and how to log and capture your footage. By the end of the week you will have shot 10-20 minutes of field-based raw footage and logged and captured your film.</p>\r\n<p>But first, let\'s spend a little time discussing what makes good video. We\'ll expand on this subject more when we talk about editing in Lesson #4, but it\'s important to have a basic understanding of video storytelling theory before you begin filming.</p>\r\n<p>The modern era of film was born in 1915 with D.W. Griffith\'s controversial epic \"The Birth of A Nation.</p>\r\n<p>Eisenstein revolutionized the use of montages to create interpretive rather than literal scenes. Until Eisenstein, if you wanted to show sorrow you would show someone weeping. If you wanted to depict pain, you would show someone getting hit in the hand with a hammer. But Eisenstein wanted editors to think more about their shot selections, urging them to employ juxtaposition to connect two seemingly disparate images. If he wanted to show sorrow, he might show a picture of a dead woman and a close up of a trembling hand. If he wanted to show pain, he might show a man hammering and then cut to a close up of his eyes bulging.</p>\r\n<p><em>Nanook of the North</em>:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"%20https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4kOIzMqso0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4kOIzMqso0</a></p>\r\n<p>Regarded as the forerunner of documentary film, much has been said about allegations that it was staged etc., but it is still the template by which many a modern documentary film is made.</p>\r\n<p>I bring up this bit of film history because whether your end goal is to make the next Hollywood blockbuster or just create better home movies, you should always be thinking about logical shot selections.</p>\r\n<p>In the field, be sure to gather the images you need that will convey the message you want to get across, and in the editing booth be sure to cut the images in the correct order to ensure the message gets delivered. But first, let\'s make sure you know how to use your camera and what equipment you will need.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>GETTING TO KNOW YOUR CAMERA:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Basic functions:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Of course, every video camera is different, so you\'re going to have to consult your camera\'s user guide on this, or just start playing around with it. But you\'ll need to know how to turn the camera &lsquo;On/Off\', press &lsquo;Record\', use the zoom rocker, mount a tripod shoe, recharge the battery (and learn how long the battery lasts), attach lights and microphone, and how to transfer footage to a computer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Advanced functions:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>White balance:</strong> White balance adjustment makes white subjects look white and allows more natural color balance for your shot. An image with a bad white balance is either too blue (cold) or too orange (warm). Most cameras have auto white balance, manual white balance, and preset white balance (indoors, outdoors, fluorescent light). Auto white balance is sometimes off the mark, so learn how to use manual white balance (it\'s often a simple, one-touch button).&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Focus:</strong> Most cameras allow auto and manual focus. Auto focus is fine if your subject is the largest thing in the frame. Manual focus is necessary if you want to track a smaller subject or you have multiple elements in the frame. Also, I find auto focus to be a bit unreliable at times. If you shoot through a rain-soaked window, for instance, you&rsquo;ll need to lock the focus on the subject, to stop it bring to focus on the water droplets on the window. To focus properly with a video camera, switch your camera to manual focus. Point it at your subject and zoom in as far as the camera will allow. Adjust the focus until the subject is as sharp as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then zoom out and compose your shot. As long as neither you nor the subject change location, you can pan the camera up and down or tilt side to side and you will never go out of focus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Exposure:</strong> Again, most cameras have auto and manual exposure. Because exposure can be tricky, use auto exposure most of the time unless you are very familiar with how it works. Auto does fine in most circumstances and I found out early that I did more harm than good by trying to mess too much with exposure. However, for cameras that have a Neutral Density (ND) filter, pay attention to when the camera says the filter is needed, usually in very bright sunlight. Otherwise your picture will be over or under exposed.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Shutter speed:</strong> Digital video is recorded in frames. Depending on your camera, it is either recorded in 30 frames a second in an interlaced scan, or 24 frames a second in a progressive scan. However, please note that cameras that support interlaced video need to record at 60 frames per second (because half the frame is recorded each half a second). Progressive scan cameras, which must be set to record at 24 frames a second, resemble the look and feel of film. Check your camera\'s manual to see which one you have and feel free to ask me if you have any questions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Audio levels:</strong> Once again, you can choose auto or manual audio levels. I like to use manual because if my subject is difficult to hear or is far away from the mic I can turn up the levels (but beware, because all of the surrounding noise will become louder too).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>SHOOTING IN THE FIELD - 10 SUREFIRE STEPS TO GETTING GOOD VIDEO:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Shoot to edit:</strong> As we learned earlier, the DNA of video are sequences, multiple shots edited together to form an action. Videos - good ones anyway - rarely consist of one long, continuous shot. To keep a scene interesting, editors are constantly switching between different perspectives and different camera angles. So if you can film with editing in mind, it will make your life much easier when you finally get back to the editing station.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shot types:</strong> The three most essential types of shots are the establishing shot, the medium shot and the close-up. Read more about them and watch video below for an explanation of how they work while editing.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Establishing shot:</strong> Where are we? What is the main action? Get at least one shot of the scene from far enough away that we can tell who, what, where and, depending on if it\'s an outdoor shot, when.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Medium shot:</strong> The subject should fill half the frame. If the shot is of someone eating, a medium shot would just barely have the plate of food and the head in the shot. You want the whole action of fork-to-plate-to-mouth to be in the shot.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Close-up:</strong> Fill the entire frame of just the subject digging their fork into their food. Then get another shot of just their mouth chewing. Get as close to the action as possible.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">Note:&nbsp; Use your camera&rsquo;s zoom for composing your shot, and forget about sing it while shooting.&nbsp; Zooming is for amateurs and war zones.</span></em></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Here is a demonstration of different shot sizes:</span></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3WwR7HsI9I%20\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3WwR7HsI9I</a></p>\r\n<p>And another very useful tutorial on common mistakes:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6N2SpA2XPI\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6N2SpA2XPI</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Shoot plenty of cutaways:</strong> Cutaways are shots that are directly related to the action and can be used to edit between two shots. For example, if your subject is talking about their prized trophy collection, you will need to show cutaway shots of some of their trophies, especially if they are talking about one in particular. Cutaways are very, very important during editing, because they allow you to cut out seconds or even minutes of the subject\'s interview so that it looks seamless.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Use the 5-Shot Rule When Shooting Actions: Actions involving people should include the following shots (Of course these can be shot in any order - you can mix it up, but the 5-shot rule will give you a nice sequence when editing.):</strong></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 1)</strong>&nbsp; Hands, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> 2)</strong>&nbsp; Close-up of face, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3)</strong>&nbsp; Over-the-shoulder, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>4)</strong>&nbsp; Wide angle <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>5)</strong>&nbsp; Different angle.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Capture what\'s important:</strong> When you\'re out on a shoot, it can be tough to know what\'s worthy of filming and what isn\'t. This is why it\'s critical to have a detailed summary of your story before you start. To prevent indecision, always stay focused on the story you want to tell, the most important characters and the key events. You won\'t capture everything, but you want to make sure you don\'t capture everything! A good rule of thumb is just to pay attention and capture what\'s interesting. Of course, if you\'re not sure, it\'s always better to over-film than to under-film.&nbsp; As you gain experience you will get a better feel for what will work.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Have fun with angles:</strong> Use the tripod whenever you can. But don\'t limit yourself to static, straight on neutral shots. Get creative and have fun with the camera. Shoot from a stool. Put the camera on the ground. Tilt the camera 45 degrees (called a Dutch-Angle shot). Rent a helicopter (okay, maybe not a real one, but multi-rotor drones that can carry a GoPro or similar camera are becoming popular.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>But it\'s not just &ldquo;artistic&rdquo; to shoot the same shot from a bunch of different perspectives - it\'s practical. When you\'re editing you\'ll want to piece clips together and the only way to do that is to cut between different takes of the same scene.</p>\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s some great demonstrations of shot sizes, angles and sequences:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jURepXxuiGE\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jURepXxuiGE</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>How to film things that are moving:</strong> Movement within your shot makes things more interesting, but use it only when it enhances your piece. For example, a video on a local rock band may be conducive to lots of movement both within the frame and using zooming, panning and tilting. However, a news analysis on a new government program for the homeless may be more effective with static, tripod shots. Either way, it can be difficult to get movement right. The following tips should help you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The more zoomed in you are to your subject, the more wobbly your image is. Be completely zoomed out when going handheld to reduce wobble.</li>\r\n<li>Start moving your camera ever so slightly before a moving subject enters the frame.</li>\r\n<li>Include close-ups of movement - such as walking feet or cars wheels spinning - to help you in the edit.</li>\r\n<li>Film 5 seconds of empty frame before an object enters the frame, and film 5 seconds of empty frame after an object leaves the frame.</li>\r\n<li>Look for moving subjects that can provide a &lsquo;wipe\' across the frame, such as a bus or a person walking.</li>\r\n<li>When following an object, aim to keep it the same size in the frame at all times.</li>\r\n<li>To avoid focus problems, keep the same distance between yourself and the subject.</li>\r\n<li>Move the camera slowly when panning or tilting on a static subject.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Demonstrated visually: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMQ9QwRlmQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMQ9QwRlmQ</a></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Camera movements:</strong> Pan (move the camera along the horizontal axis), tilt (move the camera along the vertical axis), zoom in (moving toward your subject) and zoom out (moving away from your subject).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Show, don\'t tell:</strong> Always make sure that you\'re filming the exact information that needs to be conveyed to your audience. What I mean by this is, if you want to convey the quirky personality of your interview subject, be sure to capture cutaways of his or her funky art collection, or the framed photos of them waking on their hands (if they can actually walk on their hands, make sure you get a demonstration of that, too). You should be able to show that the character has a unique personality without having to actually say it. This sounds obvious, but when I first started I would often be very literal in what I would film, and I have since learned to look for the interesting details that tell you everything you need to know.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Get close:</strong> Viewers connect to detail much better than abstraction. While it\'s important to get a few establishing shots, most of your shots should be medium close ups and close ups. When filming, I try to follow this formula: 20% wide/establishing shots/40% medium shots/40% close ups and extreme close ups. If you are conscious of this formula while you are filming it will make your life much easier while editing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Ten-seconds rule:</strong>&nbsp; When shooting, hold each shot for at least 10 seconds.&nbsp; Press record on your camera for 5 seconds before the action and keep it rolling for five seconds after. So the minimum amount of time you should record any shot is 20 seconds.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>Wear your headphones:</strong> We\'ll discuss this more in Lesson #3, but one of the most important parts of filming is making sure that your audio is clean. On my second-ever video assignment I forgot my headphones and just looked at the audio levels during my filming. When I got back I realized that there was interference running through the entire interview and the audio was useless. I will NEVER do that again and I hope this saves you an uh-oh moment like that.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>5 BASIC RULES OF COMPOSITION:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1)&nbsp; Lead the look:</strong> When interviewing people, always give your subject room to look off the frame. When filming movement, let the energy of the movement go toward the center off the frame. Show both eyes - no profile shots.&nbsp; See what I mean in the image that follows.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p><strong>2)&nbsp; Rule of thirds:</strong> Imagine that your viewfinder is divided into thirds from right to left and up to down, as in the figure below. Generally you want to position the most interesting thing in the frame (the subject\'s eyes or men building a fence) along one of the lines. Where the lines cross are the four most interesting points in the image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>3)&nbsp; Backgrounds:</strong> Backgrounds are just that - backgrounds. Don\'t let them take over your picture. Make sure that no strange objects or plants are growing out of your subject\'s head. At the same time, you want to strive for an interesting background that won\'t distract. Ideally you can take advantage of your camera\'s depth of field to make the background a bit blurry, as in the following.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p><strong>4)&nbsp; Close-ups:</strong> Video is a close-up medium. Especially on the web, your audience needs to see at all times your main point of interest. Don\'t be afraid to get as close as you can to your subject.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5)&nbsp; Balance:</strong> You do not always have to divide your picture evenly. Aim for contrasts in shapes and sizes, and don\'t always shoot head-on. Angles, high shots and low shots mixed in can be very pleasing (see below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Some more tips on sequences:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI9HDVuCllk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YI9HDVuCllk</a></p>\r\n<p>And shooting movement:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMQ9QwRlmQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zMQ9QwRlmQ</a></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>LOGGING YOUR SHOTS:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Before you can start editing, you need to know what you have. If you are on a large crew and had a Production Assistant, they may have made notes about what types of shots you got and whether they were any good or not. Because I usually shoot solo I have to log my footage later. I usually do this as it\'s capturing.

Or at least with your friends and family. Distribution is often the last thing we think about in the video production process, but of course it\'s one of the most important. And it can be one of the most confusing. The most frequent questions I get from people are about compression and distribution: What format is best for YouTube? How can I get my video on my iPad? What format do I need to put my video on a DVD? What about HD formats? While I can\'t promise to address every single distribution need, this lesson will give you a basic understanding of how compression works, what some of the most basic formats are and when to use them, and how to get the best quality through the more common distribution channels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>COMPRESSION FORMATS (ALSO KNOWN AS CODECS):</strong></p>\r\n<p>Below are some of the more popular compression formats with a brief description and what you would use them for. If all of this is a bit overwhelming right now, just skim the following section and remember to use it as a reference for when you want to distribute your video.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mpeg-2</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What is it?</em>  Part of the MPEG family, MPEG-2 uses less compression so that it looks good on televisions and higher definition mediums.&nbsp; Comes in SD and HD versions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What\'s it used for?</em>  DVD, satellite and cable broadcasts, and one of the &ldquo;legal&rdquo; formats for&nbsp; Blu-ray discs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Mpeg-4/MP4/M4V</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What is it?</em>  MPEG-4 is actually a whole family of codecs all unto itself, such as MP4, M4V, DivX and H.264. The MPEG-4 family is known for excelling in providing high quality video in small sizes and has become a standard for many portable media players.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What\'s it used for?  </em>Most commonly known as the format used for the iPad, iPhone and PlayStation Portable. But it can be used for online video, (Vimeo.com, for example, uses H.264 to provide excellent-looking video), live streaming, or playback from a PC.&nbsp; Expect to use some version of MPEG-4 quite a bit, especially if you plan to upload to the Web.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Flash/FLV</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What is it?</em>  Flash is one of the most common viewing formats for the Web, primarily because its Flash video player is universally viewable on both Macs and PCs and is installed on almost every computer. It\'s not the best-looking format (you can often see pixilation in Flash videos), but its ubiquity is what makes it so popular. The biggest problem with Flash is that you need to buy software to convert your video files to Flash. And, Apple mobile devices do not support it, which is a real pain.&nbsp; But the good news is that every video sharing site knows this so they convert your file for you. You can upload almost any codec to YouTube and it converts the file to Flash.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What\'s it used for?</em>  Web video - YouTube, Facebook and most other video sharing sites convert the videos you upload into Flash.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Quicktime/MOV</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What is it?</em>  Quicktime is Apple\'s proprietary codec and is compatible with every Apple product. Quicktime files can be edited in Final Cut Pro or iMovie, or can be streamed online using the Quicktime player. But most people use Quicktime as a high quality editing and storage format and convert Quicktime files to either Mpeg-4 or .FLV files for online viewing, and to Mpeg-2 for DVDs. Luckily, as we mentioned before, most video sharing sites like YouTube will do this for you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What\'s it used for?</em>  Some Web video (but users will need to download the Quicktime player), editing and storage.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>Windows Media Video/WMV</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What is it?</em>  This is the codec that can be produced using Windows editing applications like Adobe Premiere or Windows Movie Maker (although it is not a good codec for editing). WMV files can be used for viewing online, and mostly for viewing&nbsp; in Windows Media Player.&nbsp; Like Quicktime, it\'s best to convert your WMV file to Mpeg-4 or .FLV files for online viewing, and to Mpeg-2 for DVDs. Luckily, as we mentioned before, most video sharing sites like YouTube will do this for you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What\'s it used for?</em>  Some Web video (but users will need to download the Windows Media player) and storage. Will almost always need to be converted for online viewing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>AVI</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What is it?</em>  Another Microsoft Windows format that can actually encompass a number of formats all under the &ldquo;AVI wrapper&rdquo;&nbsp; Regard as a legacy format (DV-AVI from the days of DV tape)&nbsp; And takes up too much space.&nbsp; Should be converted to Mpeg-4 or .FLV files for online viewing, and to Mpeg-2 for DVDs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><em>What\'s it used for?</em>  Some Web video (but users will need to download a Windows Media player or an AVI player) and storage. Will almost always need to be converted for online viewing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOW DO I CONVERT MY FILE TO THE PROPER FORMAT?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Every editing software offers options for exporting to various formats.&nbsp; To put it simply, my go-to output format is:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">H.264 (.mp4) in frame size 1290 x 720, with a data rate of 12,000 kbps.</span></p>\r\n<p>This will upload to the web, play off a PC, and convert well to DVD.&nbsp; As we mentioned earlier, most video sharing sites such as YouTube allow you to upload any format and they will convert your video to Flash. If you just want to get your video up on the Web, then export from your video editing software and upload straight to YouTube.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If I want best quality for a master, I will go as close to the shooting format as possible.&nbsp; For DSLR video that would be:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">H.264 (.mov) Frame size 1920 x 1080, Data rate 50Mbps</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>And if I want to burn a Blu-ray Disc or project to an HD projector, I go to the Blu-ray space of:</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">MPEG-2 HD 1920 x 1080, 25Mbps Data rate</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>If your video editing software doesn&rsquo;t offer suitable formats, you can download a free video compression tool. Below are a few of the best compression software - some are free and some you have to pay for, that are particularly good.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.squared5.com/\">MPEG Streamclip</a>&nbsp;(Free, both Mac and Windows)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php\">Handbrake</a>&nbsp; (free for both Mac &amp; PC.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/compressor/\">Compressor </a>(Mac, comes with Final Cut Pro HD Studio)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><strong>WHERE TO UPLOAD:</strong><br /><br /><strong><em>YouTube</em></strong> is the mother of all video sharing sites, accounting for nearly 80% of all online videos watched. Because of its dominance, many other video sharing sites have followed YouTube by making it very simple to post your videos by accepting almost any format and converting it for you.</p>\r\n<p>YouTube has the advantage that, if your video has potential to go viral, it is likely to be seen by the largest number of people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The downside of YouTube is the fact that it&rsquo;s not very private, you may well have your videos ripped off, and you may also attract nasty comments from people with nothing better to do.&nbsp; Also, YouTube will add advertising to your videos and those may sometimes be wholly inappropriate.</p>\r\n<p><br /><em><strong>Vimeo</strong></em> is the professional&rsquo;s choice for sharing video.&nbsp; Their HD quality is great, the interface is clean and uncluttered, and it&rsquo;s billed as a &ldquo;respectful community&rdquo;.</p>',20,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-06 13:41:18','2015-04-07 09:30:30'),(204,65,'Creating Dynamic Abstract Compositions',NULL,'<p>I love all types of photography. Put a camera in my hands and I am a happy person. Portraits, landscapes, nature, commercial, and fine art all hold different types of challenges that I thrive on. The most fulfilling of these, in my opinion, is fine art. It\'s not necessary to compromise my artistic vision for the needs of a client. My mind is free to explore a theme or statement I feel compelled to express. I lose track of time when I am working because it doesn\'t seem like work. My favorite journey in life doesn\'t involve a car, plane or taxi. It is the zone I travel to in my imagination when I am deep in the creative mode. The feeling of achievement when I have completed a series of work is matchless because it comes from deep inside my heart and brain. Fine artists are very luck people because no matter the circumstances in life, we have our imaginations to transport us to the magical land of creativity, and all is beautiful in that land. I hope to share this feeling with you through the lessons in this course. My goal is to spark your creativity and individuality, then to give you the tools to express it.</p>\r\n<p>Our first artistic journey is designed to allow you to see the world in a very different way. Fine artists are always looking at life through filters. Different colors, textures, and patterns than what is actually in front of us. We always ask ourselves, what if? What if that tree were neon orange? What if the clouds were solid? Our first lesson will entice you to look at ordinary scenes and household items and ask: what would this look like as an abstract painting? Presented here is a simple technique that will allow you to \"paint\" with your camera. It is so much fun, you will be transported to the zone in no time, and you won\'t want to put your camera down.</p>\r\n<p>First, you need to find a suitable subject. This is easy. Almost anything that has definition of texture or color will work. You can find ready made subjects in nature or set up your own still life. I\'ll share a trick with you. Whatever subject you choose, make sure there is something of interest at the center of your viewfinder. This provides a focal point for the eyes.</p>\r\n<p>Take a look at the first photo example below. It is a straight shot taken in a local botanical garden I like to visit. Not too exciting, is it?&nbsp; When I came upon this scene, I realized it would be perfect for an abstract photo. How did I know this? I recognized the contrast of orange poppies and white wildflowers, combined with the green foliage, would be a striking color combination. In addition, the way the flowers were arranged in the landscape were conducive to an abstract. By that I mean the orange color and the white color were interestingly placed. You may not be able to see this at first, but experience will train your eyes to see abstract patterns.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Now look at the following photograph. This is the abstract photo of the exact same scene as the very first photo.&nbsp; Hard to believe it is the same subject, isn\'t it. The transformation is pretty exciting if you ask me.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The next photo example is the straight shot of a still life I set up from a random arrangement of glass rocks and marbles. I used a white scrap of matt board covered with spring green gift wrapping tissue as the background. My camera was placed on a tripod. My tripod allows me to configure it into a 90 degree angle above the table, so I am shooting directly down at the arrangement. If you cannot do this with your tripod, just make sure you have enough light for a fast enough shutter speed to hand hold your camera.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>With a little planning keeping my abstract image in mind, I placed the marbles toward the center of the frame, and the single colored rocks scattered around them.&nbsp; This photo, seen below, demonstrates how much better an abstract of an ordinary still life can be.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The next photo originated during a party. I purchased the multi-colored swizzle sticks to add some spice and color to the table. It wasn\'t long before they called me into the zone, so I excused myself for a few moments to arrange this still life and capture it. I realized I needed a center of interest, so I searched the house for the perfect item. It turned out to be a tiny jewelry box made from a mosaic of beads, mirror and glass.&nbsp; Once more showing that anything can be transformed into an exciting abstract photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s have even more fun.&nbsp; The next photo is from the same botanical garden as example 1. As with the other \"A\" examples, there is nothing special about this shot, but I knew from the placement of purples, whites, and greens, it would make a good abstract. In addition, I wanted to do a black &amp; white abstract, and the values of colors told me this shot would work very well.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p>Below is the finished abstract version. I converted the shot to a black &amp; white in PhotoShop by selecting Image&gt;Adjustments&gt;Black&amp;White. Then, in the Tint dialog section, I played with the hue and saturation to give it a reddish tint.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Here\'s another way to make your abstract unusual. The following photo example was made from a section of wild grasses blowing in the wind. I have broken my rule of having a center of interest or grouping of colors here. Why? I wanted to create a XRay-type image. This scene had a feeling of movement in the center (the windswept grasses) with defined lines around it (the stems). The combination of static vs. motion sets up a dynamic emotional pull that holds up when stripped of colors.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}<em><br /></em></p>\r\n<p>Below is the abstracted image with a little help from PhotoShop. I simply inverted the image to give it the XRay feeling. Go to Image&gt;Adjustments&gt;Invert. It\'s that easy. Notice how the feeling of movement becomes even stronger when transformed like this.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>Now grab your camera and zoom lens, and let\'s get started.</p>\r\n<p>Here is how you do it.</p>\r\n<p>1. Set your camera to Manual Mode and Manual Focus. Set your ISO to the lowest number it will go. Usually this is 50 or 100. Set your aperture to f32. These are starting points. The lighting conditions you are working with will determine if you need to make adjustments. Your goal is to get a slow shutter speed. Somewhere in the 1/10 sec range.</p>\r\n<p>2. Set up your composition in your viewfinder. Zoom your lens to the mid way point. Focus on the center of the image.</p>\r\n<p>3. Press your shutter button down 1/2 way to take a meter reading. If your shutter speed is too fast, (more than 1/60 sec) you need to add a filter such as an Neutral Density or Polarizer to block out some light. If your shutter speed is still to fast after adding a filter, your lighting conditions are too bright, and you need to choose a different location. If your shutter speed is too slow (1/2 sec or longer) you can open your aperture (a lower number) or change your ISO to a higher number to let more light in. Experiment with different combinations of f stops, apertures and ISO\'s until you get a shutter speed between 0.6 sec and 1/4 sec. Again-this depends on your lighting conditions. Make sure you are watching your evaluative metering scale. You still want a well exposed photo, so keep the arrow on the center of the scale. If you don\'t get a perfect exposure, you can fix it with your imaging processing software.</p>\r\n<p>4. Now you are ready to shoot. While you are pressing the shutter button, zoom your lens. You want to be zooming the lens while the shutter is open, taking the photo. How fast or slow you zoom the lens has a great effect on the image. Try several zooming speeds on the same subject. See which one works best, and take a few more using that zooming speed. The more you do this, the better you will become. Its so much fun you will want to try many different subjects and create your own gallery of abstract photography.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-08 12:05:50','2015-04-08 12:53:00'),(205,65,'Adding Atmospheric Emotion',NULL,'<p>Human beings react to \"mood.\"&nbsp; Think about how your frame of mind changes when the weather does.&nbsp; Sunny days make your energy spike.&nbsp; On rainy days, you like to curl up with a cup of hot cocoa, in front of a nice fire.</p>\r\n<p>Changing the mood in an average scene can make your audience react similarly.&nbsp; when you show your photography to friends, family and strangers, you want them to feel something from it.&nbsp; It\'s easy to do with the technique I\'m about to share with you.</p>\r\n<p>Your subject matter can be something very ordinary.&nbsp; Look around your house.&nbsp; What do you see each and every day - and take for granted?&nbsp; Is it your house keys?&nbsp; The fan on your desk?&nbsp; The hangers in your clothes closet?&nbsp; Look for interesting compositions, intersecting lines, angled patterns or repetitive curves.&nbsp; When choosing a subject from nature, look for the same compositional elements.</p>\r\n<p>The first example below is a photo of my own bicycle.&nbsp; Surely taken for granted, it sits unused for most of the year.&nbsp; I don\'t like to ride it if the temperature is too hot or on the frigid side of things.&nbsp; Most of the time I simply forget it\'s there.&nbsp; When I was looking around for subjects / objects to photograph for this particular lesson, my bicycle spoke to me (pun intended).&nbsp; This shot here was made up-close to the spokes, themselves.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>It\'s a nice image, but I don\'t consider it very interesting, unless it was to be used for an advertisement.&nbsp; Now take a look below at the second image made of this subject.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Notice how the mood has completely changed.&nbsp; It now has the added elements of <em>mystery</em> and <em>motion.&nbsp; </em>How did this dramatic difference come about?&nbsp; Simple - I smeared a little Vaseline (petroleum jelly) over a clear piece of glass and held it in front of my lens as I captured the image.&nbsp; I\'m making this sound simpler than it really is.&nbsp; The process requires a bit of trial-and-error.&nbsp; However, once you get the hang of it, you can really make your photos stand out from the crowd.</p>\r\n<p>Here are a few tricks to keep in mind as you try this technique.</p>\r\n<p>First, get a piece of glass that is a little larger than your lens.&nbsp; You want your lens completely covered by the glass when you hold it in place.&nbsp; Glass from an old picture frame works well for this.&nbsp; I advise taping the edges to prevent cutting yourself.&nbsp; I got a nasty cut that bled for days while teaching a workshop in the Grand Teton Mountains of Wyoming (U.S.A.).&nbsp; I had to go to a doctor when the workshop was over.&nbsp; Shards of glass were deeply imbedded in my finger - certainly not fun.&nbsp; Taping your edges will prevent the chance of this.&nbsp; Below is the photo I was making when the accident occurred.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Second, apply a very thin layer of Vaseline gel.&nbsp; A tiny bit goes far.&nbsp; Keep a couple of rags or napkins at the ready too, to wipe away any excess.&nbsp; Once you have your glass covered, try a few test shots.&nbsp; Is the Vaseline too thick or too thin for the exact effect you\'re after?&nbsp; Adjust it by wiping off more of the gel in different parts of the glass, leaving streaks.&nbsp; If you look carefully at the bicycle spokes in the second photo example above, you will notice the streaked vertical lines.&nbsp; This is what gives this photo its feeling of <em>motion.</em></p>\r\n<p>In the barn example, please observe how the middle of the photo is clearer than around the edges.&nbsp; This is a result of wiping off more Vaseline from the middle and leaving it slightly thicker, elsewhere.</p>\r\n<p>Third - experiment even further.&nbsp; Wipe off sections in the middle of the glass panel.&nbsp; then add more Vaseline around the edges.&nbsp; Try different combinations of thicker and thinner areas to see what the effect is.</p>\r\n<p>I the next photo, you see an iron gate with a flower placed on it.&nbsp; This image was made in a beautiful Spanish-style garden.&nbsp; The gate was facing the street.&nbsp; I noticed the reddish-colored tile stones leading into the garden and saw a range flower that had fallen from a tree.&nbsp; I positioned the flower in the right-hand section of the composition.&nbsp; The color was harmonious in hue with the tiles, so I made the picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>As you can see, it is a satisfactory image, but I knew the Vaseline trick would add an element of <em>emotion.&nbsp; </em>I decided to keep the Vaseline evenly smeared across the glass to create a \"rainy day\" effect.&nbsp; This photo has received a great response.&nbsp; It strikes a chord with all the romantics out there.&nbsp; Se the result below in the final example.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Now you are ready to get <em>moody</em>.&nbsp; Find your subjects and a piece of glass (handle with care) and start experimenting for yourself!</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-08 12:07:16','2015-04-08 12:56:10'),(206,65,'Overexposure - On Purpose',NULL,'<p>Hey rule-breakers, you will love this assignment.

One is to shoot a properly exposed photo, then bring it in to your software editing program and bump up the exposure. Move your slider up carefully, watching for the right blend to get the effect you want to achieve. Don&rsquo;t just slide it up all the way because it is easy to over do the technique. Use your creative eye to decide when enough is enough.</p>\r\n<p>The second way to achieve this effect is to do it right inside your camera. Use your exposure compensation scale to overexpose as you take your shot. Check your camera&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s manual to find out how to make this adjustment. It&rsquo;s very easy. You can also make a black &amp; white photo in your camera too, assuming you have a fairly new camera model.</p>\r\n<p>Now that you have seen some examples to provide you with inspiration, grab your camera and break the rules.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-08 12:11:06','2015-05-10 11:06:35'),(207,65,'Vintage Look',NULL,'<p>In this final lesson we will discover how to make a new photograph look like one taken ages ago. Journey on into the history of photography....</p>\r\n<p>The first technique takes up back to the 1960ʼs polaroid color snapshots. Snapshots were all the rage with families recording vacations, birthday parties, weddings and graduations. For an original old snapshot example, see the photo below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Sounds like today doesnʼt it? Some things never change. The desire to document our lives is a strong urge. The old snapshots have a faded, hazy look to them. Skies are washed out and color shifts lean to the yellow side. Many photos have spotted patches where the color has unevenly faded. We will use an image I took of a Model T car that is so old, it has wooden wheels and spokes. Take a look at the photo example below to view the original image. It was shot with a pocket digital camera in 2010. To make your vintage photograph, follow the directions below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Choose an image, open it in PhotoShop, and create a duplicate layer. Name this layer Gaussian Blur/Grain.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Go to Filter/Blur/Gaussian Blur. For this image I chose 3.3 pixels to satisfactorily blur the whole image. Next, I wanted to add some film grain so it looks like it was shot on film instead of what it really is - a digital capture. Go to Filter/Artistic/Film Grain. I manipulated the settings to Grain 4, Highlight Area 2, Intensity 3. Changing the Intensity helps give the photo the washed out look.</p>\r\n<p>The next thing I added to this layer is some fly specks. Have you ever noticed those brown dots on old papers or photos? Itʼs disgusting fly poop! Never thought youʼd want fly poop, did you. Well, we donʼt want the real thing, just painted poop. Too add it, click on your Brush Tool, choose a shade of very dark brown for your foreground color. Vary your brush size and the opacity as you add dots in selected parts of your image. Hereʼs a tip. Use the opacity slider in the Options Bar at the top of the PhotoShop program. This changes the opacity of just your brush marks. If you use the opacity slider in your Layers Palette, it will change the opacity of the whole layer - you donʼt want to do that. Fly specks usually occur in clusters. Make some of the specks larger and lighter, then switch your brush size and make more specks smaller and darker, and so on until you like the results.</p>\r\n<p>Step #3. We need to add a Pattern Fill to get rid of the perfectly smooth and clear look of the photo. Click on Layer/New Fill Layer/Pattern. Name it Stucco 4. Click on the arrow right next to the box with a pattern sample in it, then click on the arrow to the right of the new pop up box. Go down to Texture Fill 2. Click OK when the dialog box asks you if you want to replace the current patterns. Run your cursor over the patterns until you find the one that says Stucco 4, and select it. It takes a second for the names of the textures to appear, so give it a moment. I changed the Scale to 1,000 for the look I desired. I clicked on OK to lock it in, then returned to the Layers Palette to change the <strong>Fill</strong> (not Opacity) to 27%. Fill is located just under Opacity in the Layers Palette.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #4.</strong> I like this feel, but the Patten Fill was too heavy over the truck. To remedy this, I clicked on the Mask Layer to the right of the Texture Layer to make it active. Then, I chose my Brush Tool from the Tools Palette. Making sure the foreground color is set to black in the Tools Palette, I painted away the texture on unwanted areas of the truck.</p>\r\n<p>At this point, I took a little break. When I returned to the computer screen, I liked what I saw and knew it was time to Save As a psd document and name the image with all of the layers. As discussed before, saving the layers lets you refer back to the image for reference. See the finished result below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>I hope you have fun with this technique. Give it a try...</p>\r\n<p><strong>Technique #2</strong> takes us further back in time. Cyanotype prints are photographs that have an overall blue color. The cyanotype was invented by an English scientist and astronomer, Sir John Herschel in 1842. It was primarily used for blueprints. Anna Atkins is considered the first female photographer because she use the cyanotype technique to document her extensive collection of seaweed. The original cyanotype was made by exposing a coated paper to sunlight with the subject matter placed on top of it for a calculated number of minutes. This resulted is called a direct print. See an Anna Atkins cyanotype below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>As time moved forward, the cyanotype has come to mean any photograph that is blue in tone. It doesnʼt have to be a direct print. I found the landscape example below from an internet search.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>Here are the instructions to make a convincing cyanotype. It is really very simple. I will show you how with a photograph of a row of canoes taken at Lake Tahoe, California, in 2010. See the original image below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Choose your image, open it in PhotoShop, and create a duplicate layer. Name this layer Gaussian Blur/Grain. This is the same manipulation as in the 1960ʼs image above. Go to Filter/Blur/Gaussian Blur. For this image I chose a blur of 1.2 for an appearance of being taken by an old<br />camera. Then, I added some film grain to hide the fact that it is a digital capture. Go to Filter/Artistic/Film Grain. I manipulated the settings to Grain 2, Highlight Area 6, Intensity 0.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #2.</strong> Hit Command + J to make a new layer. Hit your Shift + Control + U keys all at once to automatically desaturate the photo. On this layer you add your cyanotype. Go to Image/Adjustments/Photo Filter/ Deep Blue. I used a Density of 67. The finished Cyanotype can be seen below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Now on to your last and most challenging antique transformation, the Carte de Visite portrait. Below is an example of an original Carte de Visite.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Carte de Visite photographs were small albumen prints mounted on cards 2-1/2 by 4 inches. They were extremely popular around the world. For the first time, relatives and friends could exchange portraits for their albums. The small size made them inexpensive and easy to send through the mail. Many came with paper frames. We will duplicate a Carte de Visite with the following instructions. I am using a portrait I took in 2009 from a modeling shoot for a hair salon. The unretouched image is below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #1.</strong> Choose an image, open it in PhotoShop, and create a duplicate layer. Name this layer Gaussian Blur/Grain. I used less blur (.08) than in the previous lessons because I wanted to preserve the details in the face. Then I went to Filter/Artistic/Film Grain, and changed the settings to Grain 1, Highlight Area 6, and Intensity 0. As I am sure you have noticed in the past experiments, these two manipulations provide a big start to an antique<br />look. Fly specks were added to this layer the same way as in the 1960ʼs example.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #2</strong> is turning the image into a black and white with a Channel Mixer Layer. At the bottom the Layers Palette, I clicked on the half black/white circle, scrolled down to Channel Mixer, and selected it. Then I clicked on the small box next to Monochrome to take out all the color. Donʼt forget to name this layer Channel Mixer/Monochrome.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #3.</strong> Now I will add a Pattern Fill. Click on Layer/New Fill Layer/ Pattern. Name it Parchment. Click on the arrow right next to the box with a pattern sample in it, then click on the arrow to the right of the new pop up box. (You will need to reset your patterns to the Artist Surfaces, since we changed them for the last example). I located Parchment, and selected it. Parchment works well because it has the feel of old paper from the era of Carte de Visites. I changed the scale to 10% and clicked OK. In the Layers Palette, I changed the<strong> Fill</strong> from 100% to 30%. I am leaving the pattern all over the portrait, even on the face, because the old images have texture there as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #4.</strong> Ok - it is time to tone the image to a sepia color. I go to the bottom of the bottom the Layers Palette and click on the half black/white circle again. This time I click on Solid Color. I pick a color in the orange/ brown tones. Then, still in the Layers Palette, I change the <strong>Opacity</strong> to 37%. At this point the image itself is done, but we are not finished. Make sure you have kept a record of your manipulations because we are going to flatten the image and your layers will be lost. The reason I asked you to name your layers is so that you can make changes as your were working on the proper layer if necessary. Go to Layer/Flatten Image and click. This creates one background layer.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Step #5.</strong> To really be convincing, this photo needs the frame around it. I have a collection of Carte de Visites from the 1800ʼs so I scanned one for the frame. I am attaching a file to this lesson so you can use it on your image. I opened the file and held the Shift key while dragging it over the portrait. The Shift key automatically centers it in to place over the portrait. Next, I take my Eraser Tool from the Tool Box bar, choose a hard brush, and begin to erase the center of the frame to expose the portrait<br />underneath. Be careful around the edges. Make them clean and neat. A hard brush is essential because it has no blur at the edges. If you use a soft brush, there not be a well defined crisp edge. The &ldquo;old&rdquo; Carte de Visite can be seen below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>On to the assignment for this final lesson ...</p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-08 12:15:31','2015-04-08 13:26:59'),(208,66,'Mentorship Stage 1',NULL,'<p><em><strong><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">TO BE AS<span style=\"color: #ff0000;\">SIGNED</span></span></strong></em></p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-09 15:58:18','2015-04-09 15:48:55','2015-04-09 15:58:18'),(209,66,'Mentorship Stage 2',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>TO BE ASSIGNED</strong></em></span></p>',17,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-09 15:58:22','2015-04-09 15:51:56','2015-04-09 15:58:22'),(210,66,'Mentorship Stage 3',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>TO BE ASSIGNED</strong></em></span></p>',17,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-09 15:55:25','2015-04-09 15:53:57','2015-04-09 15:55:25'),(211,67,'Step 1',NULL,'<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Step 1 &ndash; Setting the goal</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">The aim of the mentorship for me is to come out at the end of the 12 weeks with a solid portfolio / website that is professional and can assist me in approaching talent agencies, food magazines, restaurants, etc. to catapult a career in this field.

I know that usually in the professional world a photographer would generally be working with a food stylist, or the chef who is a pro at plating, taking the edge off doing everything (unless you are working on a cookbook I suppose). So for the purpose of making my portfolio look as professional as possible at this point given that I will be working alone, I would really appreciate it if you would share tips and tricks that could help me achieve this. For example, if we select a recipe which has a lot of cooked vegetables that would lose their colors by fully cooking them, and for the sake of the shot they would only require blanching only, and you could tell me this tip &nbsp;ahead of preparing the dish, or if a sauce may get too runny (we\'ve had this issue before if you remember my stuffed pepper dish), etc. These are basic examples for which I know the answers but I think you know what I mean :)</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Perhaps we kickstart the program with setting a goal to the number of images we want to have finalized &nbsp;to go up on the website, and even maybe pick the dishes and recipes ahead of time?</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;\">Also, if you could recommend some website/ portfolio sites I could start looking into that would be much appreciated.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></span></p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-09 16:04:01','2015-05-21 07:20:49'),(212,67,'Step 2',NULL,'<p><strong>Step 2 &ndash; Selecting &amp; Creating Images for your portfolio</strong></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&ldquo;It would be really great if you can help me select recipes from each of these categories which would highlight versatility in my work, and help me appeal to a wide array of clientele and not just one type of cuisine.

Does this make sense?&rdquo;<br /><br />Your photography portfolio is one of the best tools that you have at your disposal to market yourself as a photographer. In an instant, it shows your prospective clients how skilled you are at shooting, how creative you are, and how unified your body of work is. In short, your photography portfolio can make or break you. That&rsquo;s why deciding what to put in your portfolio is such an important consideration.<br />Photography portfolios work best when they feature a unifying theme. Not only will it make your body of work look more coherent and consistent to potential clients, but it will also attract clients who are looking for a specific type of shoot &ndash; for example you mentioned in your goal that when you approach Middle Eastern / Scandinavian restaurants you would like to have the appropriate images to meet their requirements, which means you should have typical food / dishes that specialize in these cuisines to highlight. <br /><br />While it is vital to include a variety of photographs in your portfolio, it is more important to show off your best shots. Sure, this may mean that your final image count may be somewhat on the low side&mdash;perhaps between 20 and 30 in your portfolio&mdash;but it is infinitely better than having a bigger portfolio of average or just good shots.  Good read: <a href=\"http://www.exposureguide.com/top-10-digital-photography-mistakes.htm\">http://www.exposureguide.com/top-10-digital-photography-mistakes.htm</a></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em></span></p>',17,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-09 16:06:27','2015-05-21 07:21:55'),(213,67,'Step 3',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>TO BE ANNOUNCED</strong></em></span></p>',17,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-09 16:26:10','2015-05-01 08:53:23'),(214,67,'Step 4',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>TO BE ANNOUNCED</strong></em></span></p>',17,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-10 12:31:49','2015-05-01 08:53:38'),(215,67,'Step 5',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>TO BE ANNOUNCED</strong></em></span></p>',17,5,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-10 12:34:16','2015-05-01 08:53:53'),(216,67,'Step 6',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #ff0000;\"><em><strong>TO BE ANNOUNCED</strong></em></span></p>',15,6,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-10 12:38:53','2015-05-01 08:54:08'),(217,68,'Selecting Your Assignment',NULL,'<p>Although I wasn\'t really thinking of them as such at the time, I\'ve been working on \"self-assignments\" since my high school days. As one of two students back then interested enough in photography to donate after-school hours to snapping pictures for the school newspaper, I had to be always on the lookout for strong visual topics to place on the editor\'s desk before my \"competitor\" came in with something of his own. The stories I worked on ranged from things like student fund-raising car washes on Saturday mornings to cheerleader selections and rehearsals, prior to the football season - material \"close to home\" in terms of topic and accessibility. It was at times a challenge, but I always enjoyed it and the work called \"discipline\" strongly into play as a photographer. This is something I\'ve benefited from greatly through the years, the process of coming up with a topic, researching it to the point of really knowing it and then setting out a strategy for capturing it with a camera.</p>\r\n<p>The foundation of these early experiences I carry with me to this day, with some revisions here and there brought through years seeking out and working on my own stories.&nbsp; My early motivation for self-assigning stories was to build my portfolio of photography in such a way that when I approached editors and potential employers, they could already see I was capable to handling THEIR assignment, therefore increasing my chances of landing a job I wanted.&nbsp; And even if such didn\'t happen - or happen right away - I would still sharpen my camera craft and eye as a photographer.&nbsp; There was really very little to lose, as long as things were kept in perspective.&nbsp; This was the direction I followed for years and, fortunately, if began to pay off early on in the career as I photographer I sought to establish.&nbsp; Do I still do self-assigned projects today?&nbsp; You bet!&nbsp; I do them to keep new material in my portfolio and on my website, I do them them as \"in betweens\" when working on other assigned stories and I do them just out of personal interest.&nbsp; I have a \"formula\" I apply to it all and its key points and criteria are the following:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Choose a theme, topic or subject that has broad viewer appeal - that will grab the interest of a majority of people.</li>\r\n<li>Choose a subject and/or situation that offers relative ease of access, so that coverage can be completed in a relatively short period of time (4 weeks in the case of this course) and that can be returned to in order to add things you may need and have missed during previous visits. &nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Choose a subject that you yourself as photographer are interested in. This final point is an important one. Because if you don\'t become engaged with your project, it will be surely be obvious in your coverage of it and your work won\'t speak \"honestly\" to an editor, the subject of the story or to yourself.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>I\'ll give you a relatively recent example of this - a self-assigned \"assignment,\" completed close to home (Yes, I do spend time at home on occasion) at practically no expense at all and one that held my interest from the moment I walked through the door.&nbsp; It started with a neighbor and friend of mine asking if I would pick his kids up from school on a particular day, due to his having a late meeting at work.&nbsp; I agreed and when that day came, I was introduced to a completely different schooling philosophy right in the small city I lived in.&nbsp; The <em>Waldorf School</em>, serving levels 1 through 12, operates on a non-traditional education design that mixes academic learning with everyday skill needed for life - things like gardening, woodworking, sewing and cooking.&nbsp; That evening I learned more of the school from my neighbor and the next day I was there again making a connection.&nbsp; In exchange for access granted to make photos over a three-day period, I would provide the school with visual material to be used in advertising through curricula to the public.&nbsp; We struck a deal and my self-assignment was underway.</p>\r\n<p>My \"first day at school\" was spent wandering around feeling awkward and capturing \"glimpses\" of what this whole situation was about.&nbsp; My initial aim was to create a \"sketchbook\" of the subject\'s possibilities.&nbsp; From this, I would hopefully gain a better understanding of the Waldorf\" scene\" and decide just what would be needed to complete my assignment on time.</p>\r\n<p>A first shot was of the establishing variety - a frontal shot of the German school and its sign as students filed out for their lunchtime break.&nbsp; Somewhere between a hasty snapshot and a well-composed photograph, I positioned myself for the noontime bell to ring and the older students to be descending the front steps and past the identifying sign of the school.&nbsp; As a hint of \"expression,\" I set a slow shutter speed of 1/15 sec. to blur some of the motion and made the picture with a 24mm, wide-angle lens to include just what I wanted to identify the scene.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Feeling a bit more comfortable and knowing my way around by afternoon, I asked if I might enter a science classroom.&nbsp; I started with a seat near the rear of the room and just watched and listened for a while.&nbsp; When the teacher made himself comfortable and started to interact in a more informal way with his students, I moved from my position and began to take unobtrusive shots from around the classroom.&nbsp; The next \"sketchbook\" entry of this follows.&nbsp; Once again, I strove for a composition of sorts and wanted too to include a bit of \"moment\" amid the exchange of teacher and student.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Students themselves were next and in the photo below I sat, took a few \"dummy\" pictures before these science-class students overlooked I was crouched in front of them with a wide-angle lens, awaiting a poignant moment.&nbsp; In this situation, my compositional instincts got the better of me and I began working beyond my sketchpad.&nbsp; I had to consiously backup to remind myself of the mission for that day, at hand.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>From classroom to workshop was my next move for this sketchbook exercise.&nbsp; It was easier here - more room to move around and then move on to the next subject of interest in the room.&nbsp; If you know my work, you know I use wide-angle lenses almost exclusively, getting in close to my subjects and the action they\'re involved with.&nbsp; In the photograph below, I positioned myself to capture this female student\'s woodworking skills in the immediate foreground of the frame and allowed enough background sharpness to relate the extend of the work-space and those using it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The final two images I\'m presenting below focus on the experiential nature of the Waldorf School experience.&nbsp; A student kitchen / classroom teaches culinary \"survival\" skills in a coed setting.&nbsp; Likewise, a large garden area on the school property offers an opportunity for students to acquire garden skills, taught by a knowlegable and patient instructor.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the most successful self-assignments are accessible in every way - in terms of permissions required and proximity to you the photographer.&nbsp; Returning to the location or situation will most always be a necessity and wanting to do so requires involved interest on the photographer\'s part, as well.&nbsp; Next comes figuring out just how you\'ll accomplish your chosen project and this is where a visual \"sketchpad\" comes in handy.</p>',7,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-13 08:50:05','2015-04-13 09:29:51'),(218,68,'Planning Your Project',NULL,'<p>As we talked about last week (Lesson #1), a visual \"sketchbook / sketchpad\" is a great way to initiate a self-assigned photo project. It gives you an overview of possibilities, starts to focus your ideas and gets creative juices flowing. This week\'s lesson moves the process a step further to the planning stage - setting out just how and what you should accomplish in the amount of time you have.</p>\r\n<p>To demonstrate all this, I\'m going to focus in this week\'s lesson on a self-assigned story produced about a year ago in Delhi, India.&nbsp; I had completed an earlier magazine assignment in the north of the subcontinent and had several days \"down time\" before leaving the country.&nbsp; Just sitting around and waiting isn\'t my thing and as for most everyone else, time is money.&nbsp; I needed to use my camera until I left the city.</p>\r\n<p>Stories and photo projects are pretty much everywhere, particularly in a chaoic South Asian city like Delhi.&nbsp; The city has really two parts.&nbsp; There\'s \"New\" Delhi, the commerical and administrative center and there\'s the old part of the city that retains much of its eclectic character and energy.&nbsp; This is the side of the city I like when I think photography.&nbsp; It\'s colorful, ever-moving and many-layered in terms of religion and social and cultural fabric.&nbsp; And, one cultural \"thread\" that runs through both adjoining urban segments is the cinema.&nbsp; Indian\'s love movies and they are enjoyed on a regular basis from the top of society to the bottom, if only it be in fantasy and daydreams through the varied and dramatic movie billboards that mark their coming.&nbsp; I\'ve always been drawn to these expressive and bigger-than-life murals like those pictured below, that stand above the dusty streets throughout the city.&nbsp; At this point in my Delhi stay, I stopped to ponder and then began to inquire.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>I approached the desk clerk at the hotel in which I was staying, asking if he might know of someone who could give me information about the billboard-producing situation in the Indian capital.&nbsp; In India, everyone knows someone, who knows someone who knows how and where to get what is needed.&nbsp; The desk clerk made several phone calls and in an hour or less, a family member in his twenties was standing in the hotel lobby, ready to offer his services as guide and interpreter to help out.&nbsp; Such a person, whether paid or just lending a hand and advice, is always beneficial to getting the information and oftentimes access, to accomplishing what you want photographically.&nbsp; My guide told me that movie billboards in Delhi were being produced more and more by machines, pieced together and sent out to towns and cities all over India.&nbsp; However, he happen to know of two still-existing traditional workshops that produced billboards by hand - and he was ready to take me there.&nbsp; We jumped on his motorscooter and my self-assignment was underway.</p>\r\n<p>Crossing the city, weaving delicately in and out of busy traffic, we crossed into the crowd-packed narrow streets of Old Delhi.&nbsp; It was here we were told that the last movie billboard workshops were located.&nbsp; We asked as we went and eventually reached the first of our destinations, made contact and I walked around shooting my sketchbook beginnings.&nbsp; We spent an hour or so there and moved onto the second and larger situation, where a team of designers and painters were busy at work.&nbsp; By day\'s end I had what I needed to make some decisions and set direction for the time that remained.&nbsp; Over a Indian meal at my hotel that evening, I set out a schedule for my second day of shooting - a plan that would include overview shots, middle-distance images and close-up pictures to move my self-assignment along in a logical and visually interesting way.</p>\r\n<p>Upon our mid-morning arrival the next day, we were told that the workshop owner was not on site, but passed along his permission to photograph.&nbsp; The only stipulation was that I would leave behind some of my images before leaving the city.&nbsp; It was a fair deal and I agreed.&nbsp; It didn\'t take long for the six or eight workers at this neighborhood workshop to get used to my presence.&nbsp; Before long, I was moving around freely, capturing the kinds of images I\'d set out in my plan to include and buying some cold soft drinks for all to ease the way.</p>\r\n<p>I strove for broad coverage of the scene to start, working from the \"outside\" and moving into the situation as I began to put the pieces of what was happening together.&nbsp; Through the lens I started to conceptualize for myself, just what the \"story\" was about and how best to portray it with a camera.&nbsp; The image below represents just such a \"scene-setting\" perspective - one of several painters working on an eye-catching creation for an upcoming Bollywood hit.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Note too in the image above that, unlike the \"snapshot\" images that fill a visual \"sketchbook\" for a self-assigned project, the planning stage of things takes the photographer in a more defined direction.&nbsp; At this point, I begin to think \"Photographs,\" rather than the \"snapshots\" I was making of this and that in the earlier phase of things.&nbsp; I was now thinking more about compositions and kinds of shots I would eventually be needing. With this image, for example, I was composing in a rule-of-thirds manner, placing the painter (subject) near the lower left intersection of imaginary lines crossing my viewfinder, dividing it into thirds both vertically and horizontally.</p>\r\n<p>Color played a role for me here too.&nbsp; The orange tones harmonize and unify the photo, throughout.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the strongest color images will be those that limit the number of colors to three or fewer closely-related hues.&nbsp; Lastly in terms of this particular scene-setting image, I was drawn to the \"eyes\" gazing down throughout the frame and this offered the theme of what this photo was to be - a slight bit phychological, enticing the viewer to come back for more.</p>\r\n<p>Middle-distance shots are an important addition to a self-assigned story project, as well.&nbsp; In the next photograph of a workshop painter comparing his nearly finished production to the movie industry flyer that inspired it, I came in close to the situation with a 50mm lens.&nbsp; Filling the frame with just this comparison, I was attempting to bring the viewer closer to the creative process of these billboard artists.&nbsp; Design plays a key role in this photograph too.&nbsp; The diagonal lines of one body leaning in one direction, while the second leans to the opposite side of the frame, adds visual tension and energy to the photograph and seems to fit well with body-language moves that characterize much of the movie industry of India.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Close-up shots, as in motion picures, play an important role in visual storytelling.&nbsp; Try to include plenty of them in your self-assigned coverage.&nbsp; The best will be kept and the rest weeded out in the editorial process later.&nbsp; Close-ups add interest and transition from one key shot to the next and are the \"connective tissue\" that tie photo stories and essays together.&nbsp; The image below is just such a shot.&nbsp; Wandering around the larger of the two studios, I saw this pile of movie industry advertisements laying on a bench and a painter talking a break, next to them.&nbsp; The colors caught my eye at first, but even more than this, I liked the man on the page looking toward the artist as if to ask, \"When will I be placed on canvas next?\"&nbsp; I used a 50mm lens once again for this shot and moved in tightly to include just what I wanted in the close-up composition.&nbsp; Keep your eyes open for these kinds of details when you\'re photographing the scenes and situations for your assignment.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>In summary, the initial stage of a self-assigned photo project will benefit greatly from a \"stretchbook\" tour of the situation.&nbsp; Once you\'ve decided on a project through these, it\'s time to get more focused in terms of subject matter and the kinds of photographs you\'ll take to tell the story best.&nbsp; Tell the viewer where they are with overview shots of a scene-setting nature,&nbsp; Then move closer to capture action and details with middle-distance pictures.&nbsp; Finally, get right in there to make close-up photographs that allow the viewer to feel they are there, experiencing exactly what you are with a camera.&nbsp; Taken together, attention to these kinds of shots will put your self-assignment on its feet and give it a direction to go in.</p>',18,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-13 09:48:05','2015-04-13 09:48:05'),(219,68,'Capturing the Images',NULL,'<p>By this time on a self-assigned photo project, a fairly clear direction should be set. You have already created a rough draft via your sketchbook of just what may lie ahead. You have then taken this further to plan just how your assignment will need to progress in terms of what to shoot and the kinds of shots that will take your coverage toward a successful and timely completion. This final point is an important one, for like any photographic project others might hand you, the one you\'ve given yourself needs to have a hard and fast <em>Deadline</em> too.</p>\r\n<p>An underlying theme of this course from the start must be a degree of self-discipline and sound organization. Contacts need to be made and maintained, a time- and content-effective plan for maintaining an adequate production pace to deadline and an ever-clearer vision of what the end product should look like and communicate to your viewer. This isn\'t to say that an element of flexibility and adaptability shouldn\'t be included in the process - it should and needs to be. Unforeseen events are bound to happen, appointments made fall through and the weather isn\'t always on the same track as you are.</p>\r\n<p>For all such less than desirable eventualities, a Plan B should be somewhere close behind. If it rains and you\'ve scheduled on outdoor shoot, either use that downpour to illustrate how the locals deal with the weather or find a way to incorporate this into your coverage. Alternatively, exchange the day with that indoor shoot you had planned two days later. There is always a way to turn things - as best you can - in your favor. I\'ll give you an example.</p>\r\n<p>Not long ago I was in Berlin on a one-day shoot for a German lifestyle magazine. While there, I had by chance heard of a women\'s\' boxing program established to build confidence in young women who were struggling in school - and life. I did a bit of research that brought me in contact with the creator and director of the program, a Canadian woman who taught psychology and experimental learning at the Free University of Berlin. A phone call set me up for my final night in the city. I was invited to come by a school gym where the girls met for workout and practice, three days per week.The winter months meant that darkness set in earlier, already around five in the afternoon. What I\'d hoped for at my shortly after four arrival, was nice late afternoon rays of sun wafting through the large translucent windows of the gym walls. Instead, it was cloudy and already almost dark. What I was left to work with were grim-encrusted high overhead florescent lights, just about a photographer\'s worst nightmare. What do? Well, the short answer is, I basically jumped in and went to work.</p>\r\n<p>As with most situations, a photographer has to just watch for a while before deciding just how his or her coverage will be done. I sat in the gym and put some gear together, readying myself for what MIGHT happen. Gradually twenty to thirty young women filed into the workout area that included exercise mats, free weights and a full-size boxing ring.</p>\r\n<p>The director of the program came onto the scene and the girls broke into smaller groups and began to stretch and limber up for the two-hour session ahead. I walked around with a wide-angle zoom on my camera and began to compose photographs of each exercise group. With the light it wasn\'t easy. I found myself adjust the ISO setting of my camera as I moved from better-lit areas of the gymnasium to the corners, where less than desirable amounts of light fell on the scene. The shoot was challenging, but I made the best of the situation.</p>\r\n<p>I didn\'t just shoot haphazardly either. I knew I needed shots in each of the categories described in the previous lesson - scene-setting shots, middle-distance images and close-up detail photographs that would connect key pictures shot to move this story of women boxers along in both and interesting and informative way. That is, I was being mindful of both style and content, respectfully, in the kinds of shots I was making.&nbsp; Below are 15 images - the best in terms of light, color, composition and \"sense of moment\" (an action high-point), culled from over 200 photos I made during this evening session.&nbsp; These would represent the raw edit from which my final self-assignment would be made.</p>\r\n<p>The first four images below represent my scene-setter / overview choices.&nbsp; Once again, these and all the rest of my photographs were chosen on the basis of four criteria - good light, good color, interesting composition (basically using the Rule-of-Thirds guideline) and sense of moment - that little something over and above the ordinary that raises interest in a photograph.&nbsp; Framing a scene with elements related to the main subject in a logical way is a good add visual interest to a photograph and draws the viewer into the scene - here a meditational / centering moment before starting the kinetic phase of the evening.&nbsp; To do this framing, I got into the boxing ring and shot through the ropes to the evening assemblage of women boxers in the background.&nbsp; I set a high ISO on my camera (i.e.ISO 800) in order to use an aperture setting of 5.6, so that both ropes and my subject would be captured in relatively sharp focus.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Also belonging to this category of shots, the second image below was also an attempt to establish the scene of boxing by placing a punching sack in the middle of my composition, with the women warming up around it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The next scene-setting shot incorporates motion blur as a way of interpreting the energy and enthusiam of the evening.&nbsp; I got down low with my wide-angle lens and set a shutter speed of 1/15 sec., watched the women as they ran laps around the gym and decided on a point of focus and when the most colorfully dressed of the group reached the foreground point of my composition, I squeezed the shutter button.&nbsp; In fact I made an number of captures of this situation, changing camera position a bit each time, until I landed the image I wanted.&nbsp; Keep in mind, that as a creator of visual story - self-assigned or not, you want to keep visual interest high and one way to do this is not JUST to document what is happening with your photos, but to <em>interpret</em> the scene and subject to better bring the action and emotion across to the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In this final shot of this category of images, I\'ve captured part of the group returning exercise mats to their storage area at the end of the evening.&nbsp; This shot may well be the \"closer\" for my self-assigned coverage, but at this stage of the process, I still wasn\'t sure where it would de used.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>The next five images below are my middle-distance coverage <em>selects</em> for this evening.&nbsp; The first three photos rely heavily on <em>strong and immediate foreground interest </em>to both create visual interest and to carry informational content, as well as lead the viewer\'s eye deeper into these wide-angle compositions.&nbsp; Remember that wide-angle lenses are most effectively used in this way, to lend viewer immediacy as if he or she were right there with the subjects.&nbsp; Note too through this wide-angle perspective, <em>layers</em> or visual planes are established from foreground to background, relating on element to the next in a visually logical way.&nbsp; Each layer supports all the others from front to back of the composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>In the next middle-distance capture below, I\'ve included a different camera perspective by photographing a part of the group doing floor exercises, led by their coach and coordinator of this women\'s boxing program.&nbsp; Two things to point out in this composition are that I tried to place the coach near the center of the action with particpants around her - a compositional choice to emphasize the coordinator\'s importance in the program.&nbsp; And, I ran the mats and participants somewhat diagonally through the frame.&nbsp; Diagonal lines add energy and visual interest to compositions and this seemed topically appropriate here.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>The remaining image in this middle-distance cateogory below is aanother use of interpretive technique.&nbsp; I chose a mirror on the wall to capture the reflection of two sparring boxers.&nbsp; Keep an eye open for such reflections, as well as relevant shadows, to bring an element of additional interest to your self-assigned photo layout.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>In my coverage category of close-up and detail shots, I chose the following six images as possible contenders for my final layout.&nbsp; The first two rely heavily on that sense-of-moment action point I\'ve been mentioning.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>The remaining for shots include both this sense-of-moment photographed in close proximity to the subject, as well as a final interpretive shot with the girl wrapping her hands in preparation of pulling on the boxing gloves, captured with a shutter speed setting of 1/8 of a second.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment14}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>In summary of this self-assigned evening at the boxing ring, I can say it was intense.&nbsp; I needed to be spontaneous, flexible, adaptive and ready for anything to get the coverage I wanted in just one evening.&nbsp; Oftentimes assignments are like this, particularly self-assignments a photographer happens onto in the spur of the moment.&nbsp; Stay loose, be creative with the elements you\'ve got to work with and you\'re pretty much guaranteed to get what you want.</p>',18,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-04-13 13:21:58','2015-04-13 13:21:58'),(220,68,'Toning the Final Layout',NULL,'<p>Keeping in mind that an important criterion for a self-assigned story choice is the ability to return to your subject and situation for additional coverage, should you need to. If this is the case for you, this final week of the course is the last chance to do so - to fill in any gaps in coverage that might remain.</p>\r\n<p>In this same context, remember too that every story must consist of a beginning which grabs viewer attention, a middle section that holds viewer attention and an end to the coverage that rewards the viewer for staying with you throughout your presentation. By \"reward\" I mean a closing final photograph that brings closure and resolution to the visual story told, leaving the viewer with the feeling that he or she has been both informed and \"entertained.\" This is where the style and content of your images come into play.</p>\r\n<p>Any photo story should be able to be told in no more than eight well-chosen images. These images should include the basics of any storytelling project - that\'s who, what, where, when, why and how. In addition, your coverage needs to be true and it needs to be fair in its portrayal of the subject and situation.</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned in the very first lesson of this course, your story needs to connect. That is, in broad perspective, someone has to care about the story and the people in it. Otherwise, the story isn\'t worth telling.</p>\r\n<p>Your story needs to have pace, built through visual narrative and variety of types and placement of images you use to tell it to the viewer. This is where your photographer\'s eye and editing intuition come in.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, your photo story should feel real. Emotion is a powerful connector and can go a long way toward helping humans to understand one another. Think how you can use your images to express the emotion range of your story and its characters.</p>\r\n<p>Now let\'s apply all of this, as an example, to my self-assigned women\'s boxing take.</p>\r\n<p>I chose this close-up shot below as my \"opener\" for two reasons.&nbsp; The red of this young woman\'s shirt and her facial expression as she struggles to chin herself on the bar, draws the viewer\'s attention right away.&nbsp; Furthermore, this image exemplifies the goal of this women\'s boxing program to empower young women through physical conditioning and the development of a healthy and strong self-image.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Although I could have placed the next image in the third position of my layout, I chose the photo below to establish at this point the setting of my self-assigned story.&nbsp; And I selected this shot over the two other scene-setter possibilities because of its aesthetic qualities.&nbsp; I simply liked the arrangement of participants around the punching bag, this for me gave the feel of \"unity\" for a common and supportive goal.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>My third picture choice is a wide-angle shot exhibiting those \"layers\" I earlier mentioned.&nbsp; I like the immediate foreground prominence of the girl lifting weights on the left and the subject-supportive figures engaged in the same activity throughout the background of this picture.&nbsp; Also, I like the transition provided by this photo from strength tested in the opening shot, to quietly stretching as a group in the second and now back to body-building here in this third choice for my final layout.&nbsp; Remember that you want to include \"pace\" as a characteristic of a dynamic photo sequence and the variety of these three first images together adds energy to this story.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In the next shot there is a return to the \"group\" and back to more \"passive\" strength building with the program\'s director at the center of things.&nbsp; I felt it necessary to establish this director/coach - student relationship at this nearing middle-point of the story.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>A middle-distance shot followed by a close-up of the coach\'s direct involvement with the girls comes next.&nbsp; I like this combined presentation of \"mentorship\" exhibited by the program director in this pair of photographs - there to show facilitate the way for these young women.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>The final close-up shot below gives the viewer a feel for what this character-developing program for young women is really all about - pride, confidence and conduct.&nbsp; The touching of boxing gloves here in the immediate foreground of this wide-angle shot portrays \"good sportsmanship\" and the willingness to go out and text oneself in the \"ring of life.\"&nbsp; In this shot, the mentor and coach for these girls takes a \"backseat,\" as interpreted via her being slightly out-of-focus, but still there in the background to point the \"right way\" forward in the role of referee.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>If the previous photo represents the turning point and poised climax of this self-assigned story, the final image below delivers complete resolve.&nbsp; Here depicted are the women, working once again as a team - one there for the next - putting the gymnasium back the way they found it for the next time they meet.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Now, although this self-assigned project was short in duration, it was challenging in a number of ways and exemplifies well just what a photographer is often confronted with in much longer and broader photo situations. That is, I first needed to make in this case a mental \"sketchbook\" of the situation. This I did very quickly by watching the girls come into the gym and interact before getting into training roles. Once I got an idea of how things would and where be happening, I made a quick plan as to just how I would cover this whole situation. I knew I needed scene-setting and context shots. I decided just which aspects of the evening would be best represented by middle-distance shots with a 50mm lens on my camera and which I wanted close-up, detail photos of. Sometimes things happening too quickly for the plan I had devised and I needed to adapt my onward strategy to these changes. In a very real sense, this evening spent covering a women\'s boxing program designed to build physical strength and confidence was like this four-week course in microcosm, complete with deadline reached in my hotel room late that evening as I edited my photos and made my layout choices.</p>\r\n<p>And was my photo adventure worth the time and effort? It was - I sold my picture story to a Berlin newspaper\'s Sunday magazine several weeks later, earning enough for my next self-assigned project.

Once your own portfolio of images is underway, you\'ll be able find new faces in agencies, modeling schools or through model scouts.&nbsp; Find the most photogenic young person you can, as it is - more than anything else - the face that makes the picture.&nbsp; Casting is key.&nbsp; The images you take will not only represent the model but will present you and your skills as a model photographer.</p>\r\n<p>Agencies have specific requirements, which are standard throughout the industry.&nbsp; Images need to be age-appropriate to the model and should not be overtly \"sexy\" or \"cheesy.\"&nbsp; The model should be simply dressed and without too much hair styling and make-up and without hat or sunglasses.&nbsp; Posing should be natural. The eyes should be calm and the expression, pleasant.</p>\r\n<p>Backgrounds used should not distract from the model, but often a simple wall can make a picture look like a \"mug shot.\"&nbsp; The ideal spot is a place where someone would normally stand, sit or lean.&nbsp; The aim is to&nbsp; give the model a more relaxed body position, so he or she they can concentrate on their facial expressions.&nbsp; \"Open shade\" (e.g. that found beneath a shady tree or awning on a sunny day) and the use of a reflector to bounce in additional light, can be quite flattering.&nbsp; Such also makes it easier for the model to open their eyes - and if you prefer, a flash (on- or off-camera) can be used for fill light, too.&nbsp; However when adding the latter, avoid having the flash leave a shadow outlining the model, against a wall.&nbsp; As for \"settings,\" local parks, fields, alleyways, steps and stairs in urban settings, are all good starting points for location choice.&nbsp; Lastly, be sure to scout-out locations ahead of your shoot to ensure that the light will be as you want it, at that specific time of day.</p>\r\n<p>The images below were all shot with models belonging to the \"new faces\" category.&nbsp; The light was that of morning and the location was a series of local parks in the Miami, Florida area.&nbsp; I shot with an 85mm, f1.8 lens set to aperture f2.8 and my Canon 5D camera was set to capture RAW files at ISO 400.&nbsp; The wide aperture setting was made to soften / blur the background, but note that the same sort of blurred background can be achieved by making sure there is a large distance between the model and the background.</p>\r\n<p>First Model:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Second Model:</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Since these were both young women, I kept their clothing simple and age-appropriate, opting for shorts, tank tops and blouses, avoiding too much pattern or prints.&nbsp; These are items they brought themselves from their own wardrobes.&nbsp; Young models tend to wear modern casual clothes so I always ask them to bring a variety of items to the shoot - such as jeans, blouses, tank tops, shorts, mini skirts, and other things they love to wear and feel good in.&nbsp; Long limbs are essential for models so I avoid covering them up too much, if I can.&nbsp; For example - if the model is wearing skinny jeans, I make sure she has bare arms.&nbsp; Or if she is wearing a larger shirt, I put it with something that shows off her legs.&nbsp; \"Proportion\" is important so the model doesn&rsquo;t look too naked or lost in a pile of layers.</p>\r\n<p>I wanted to emphasize their beautiful skin and long hair, so I shot in open-shade, under trees in morning sunlight. It\'s okay if small patches of light hit the face, as long as it isn&rsquo;t distracting or unflattering in any way. Make sure the model is able to open their eyes without squinting.&nbsp; Calm eyes give the model a dreamy, relaxed quality.&nbsp; The eyes have to &ldquo;talk&rdquo; to the camera and be interesting and confident in appearance.</p>\r\n<p>Besides, this, the model should have a soft expression in the mouth and jaw.&nbsp; Sometimes a model will tense-up their lips or jawline when shooting.&nbsp; When this happens, I find that if they close their lips without clenching their teeth, it makes them have a more pleasing look.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes it\'s possible to work with the wind to animate the hair, but other times you have to create a wind effect.&nbsp; I frequently ask someone to wave the reflector&nbsp;or large piece of cardboard close to the model to give the hair some lift, in a natural way.&nbsp; To show off the cheek bones, which are the hallmark of a photogenic face, it is good to open the face by having the hair away from it - not touching the face too much, but framing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For young women, simple grooming for a test means clean and basically styled hair, concealed blemishes (with a light product and powder), blotting papers for shiny skin (instead of lots of powder which shows in digital images), tidy eyebrows, mascara and lightly-applied lip gloss or lip balm.&nbsp; Young guys should have a freshly shaved face, groomed eyebrows, concealed blemishes, wear lip balm and sport a good professional haircut.</p>\r\n<p>Shoulders and a long neck give a graceful, almost dancer-like quality to models, as well.&nbsp; Position your camera so that you don&rsquo;t distort the neck or make it disappear all together.&nbsp; Shooting from too far above or too far below the eye-level of the model will create a distortion that could make the neck vanish or, alternately, make the head much too small in relation to the shoulders.&nbsp; If the model tilts his or her head at all, make sure it isn&rsquo;t too much, as a face turned on it&rsquo;s side looks like neither the photographer or the model knew really what would look professional.&nbsp; A confident model with an asymmetrical face can look straight into the camera with shoulders squared and look - amazing!</p>\r\n<p>If a model has nice hands and graceful gestures, try some frames where they have their hands near their face, just for some variation.&nbsp; Make sure they don&rsquo;t hide any part of the face at all, just enhance the overall image.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let the model squash their face or chin onto a hand or fist.&nbsp; The trick is to give the impression that the model is leaning on a hand, not actually applying pressure to the face. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />If a model has trouble achieving a calm face, try asking her to imitate the expression of the Mona Lisa.&nbsp; Everyone knows this picture and it brings to mind just what expression, confident eyes, slight smile, long neck and beautiful overall look, are called for.&nbsp; I get great looks out of models when I tell them to channel their inner Mona Lisa.</p>',0,1,'rajesthan.jpg','image/jpeg',8238,'2015-05-08 07:58:07',NULL,'2015-05-08 07:58:07','2015-05-08 07:58:07'),(230,74,'Locations, Model Direction, Lighting',NULL,'<p>My photography teacher told me that one of the most important elements of a photo shoot, is to see the images in your mind before you ever start shooting.&nbsp; The aim is to have a clear direction of what you want to do - to have a plan and treat it like an assignment.&nbsp; Doing so will allow your creativity to come out once the ball is rolling, so you can take advantage of the circumstances each shoot presents. <br /><br />With each model test you do, your goal should be to grow as a photographer and to add more interesting images to your portfolio.&nbsp; During a typical test, you should aim to have a variety of full-length images, portraits, movement shots and to show variations in the light - how it plays on the model&rsquo;s skin and hair.</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes it can be hard to think of a creative angle or approach - on the spot, so the more well informed you are, the better.&nbsp; Magazines, blogs and model agency websites are great places to research images that are strong.&nbsp; In addition, these sites can inspire you to reach and stretch your skills.&nbsp; Try keeping a file of images on your computer that you can refer back to - to give you ideas about location, styling, lighting, hair and make-up, etc. Read magazines constantly to keep up on, not just fashion trends, but visual trends so that you know what style of photography is current and looks new.&nbsp; Everyone is always looking for the &ldquo;new&rdquo;.&nbsp; The idea is not to copy these images, but to be inspired by them.&nbsp; No copied image is ever as good as the original, as all the elements that went into that image are not at all what you will have on your own shoot, so shoot your own original concepts.&nbsp; At the same time be very aware of what looks fresh and interesting in the market - <em>NOW</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Another advantage to educating yourself visually, is to learn what angles and body positions work for models.&nbsp; Clients want models to have long limbs, square shoulders, posture, graceful movements and eyes that &ldquo;talk&rdquo;.&nbsp; A model can&rsquo;t use an image that makes her legs look short or squat, just as she can&rsquo;t use images that distort her in any way - including her face.&nbsp; Where the photographer stands and directs the lens in relation to the model, can completely alter her appearance.&nbsp; If she is less that 5&rsquo;9&rdquo; or 175cm tall, it can then be to the model\'s advantage to make her legs appear long and lean.&nbsp; For this, you might want to position yourself at her waistline or slightly lower, to better capture this kind of look.&nbsp; If the model has a really square jawline, then a portrait where she turns her head off-center a bit, would be more feminine and flattering than a direct-to-camera shot.&nbsp; When you do your research, note how the model is positioned and why it works, then emulate that in your own approach.</p>\r\n<p>It is important for a testing photographer to have a few basic items ready to use depending on the location and concept.&nbsp; I like to keep a large white or grey sheet, a wooden crate, a reflector, plastic chip bag clips with rubber tips, safety pins and sticky tape, handy.&nbsp; You can hang the sheet on a wall with the tape, use the clips and pins to hold the models clothes in place, the wooden crate for the model to sit on, etc.&nbsp; Another item that works well in certain circumstances, are sheer curtain panels that can give a dreamy quality to your set and look interesting when they catch the wind.&nbsp; Learn to be inventive with your backgrounds, while not distracting from the model.</p>\r\n<p>Once you have a general concept in mind for your next shoot, the model chosen, styling planned out and the location picked, give yourself a list of things you would like to accomplish in that shoot.&nbsp; For example, you might want to concentrate on portraits, movement and full-length shots.&nbsp; Directing the model is key in getting her to be an active participant in the creative process.&nbsp; As you are about to shoot, discuss with her what you are aiming to do in that particular shot, so she can collaborate with you and actively play a part in the dialog.&nbsp; If you are shooting portraits, tell her where you are cropping the shot and explain - in a simple manner - what you would like her to do with her eyes and expression.&nbsp; If you are shooting full-length, explain the body position you would like her to assume and then allow her to change it up a bit herself - just to keep her natural and inspired.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let a model get stuck in a rut, where she doesn&rsquo;t know what you are trying to shoot and can&rsquo;t visualize it in the least.&nbsp; Time-to-time, show the model the image on the camera and explain to her why you like the shot, letting her know she is on the right track or what she could be doing differently.&nbsp; While you don&rsquo;t want to remove the creative process from your own hands, keep in mind that you are working as \"a team\" and the model\'s unique qualities can really add to the image, if you work in harmony together.</p>\r\n<p>On the shoot in the photos below, I took my model to a local park at the edge of the beach.&nbsp; We shot along the water&rsquo;s edge in the morning light as it twinkled on the water.&nbsp; The backlighting really suited her complexion and hair.&nbsp; The wind animated both her clothes and hair, which added a soft quality to the images.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>We next worked onto movement shots (below), in order to showcase this model\'s dancer-like look and ability to move gracefully.&nbsp; If a model is stiff or awkward, it is up to you to make her confident enough to get moving &ndash; and sometimes that awkwardness can be eye-catching if you are able to capture it in an interesting way.&nbsp; My model is an actual dancer, so movement is quite easy for her and that shines through in these type of shots.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>I shoot portraits whenever I can, even if it means interrupting a full-length shot to change lenses to an 85mm, to do it.&nbsp; If the hair, expression, background and lighting are all coming together into a nice beauty shot, I\"ll grab it while I can.&nbsp; Spontaneity sometimes gives a better image that a carefully planned idea. I get the model to angle her chin, play with her eyes and lips and I move her around until the light is just right to capture it all.&nbsp; Models feed off the energy of a photographer, who is obviously inspired and creative.&nbsp; And no one minds hearing the photographer gasp when something is really pretty in the camera! <br /><br />My model on this day was not the typical height for a fashion model, so I employed visual tricks to make her appear taller.&nbsp; I asked her to put on a short skirt and heels and silhouetted her against a background where she would stand out (photos below).&nbsp; I shot from just below her waist and asked her not to look down at me, as that makes the eyes look hooded and dark.&nbsp; I asked her to vary leg and hand positions and reminded her to pay attention to her expression, which is still extremely important even in a full-length image.&nbsp; Models have to model from the top of their head to the tips of their toes - in every single shot.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}<br /><br />Don&rsquo;t forget to let the model&rsquo;s personality come shining through.&nbsp; Let her smile and laugh, let her use her hands and gestures to personalize a shoot.&nbsp; She is a story and together your shoot is like a \"mini-movie,\" with her being \"The Star.\"&nbsp; Let her beauty and nature come through in the images and you will have a happy model and agency, not to mention great shots for your own growing portfolio.</p>',0,2,'redfort.jpg','image/jpeg',9549,'2015-05-08 07:58:43',NULL,'2015-05-08 07:58:44','2015-05-08 07:58:44'),(231,74,' The \"Fashion Edge\"',NULL,'<p>Photographers who want to break into fashion and beauty photography need to build a strong portfolio with beautiful models.&nbsp; This will open doors to local publications and fashion designers who could eventually become your clients.&nbsp; It is important to add fashion and beauty images to your portfolio to show your esthetic and creative range. &nbsp;<br /><br />Refer to your inspiration files to come up with a feasible concept that you would like to try, keeping in mind possible locations that you have available to you.&nbsp; Parks, urban areas, beaches, alleyways, fields, etc. can all inspire.&nbsp; For the shoot I present here, I chose an urban area on a quiet weekend morning when there were few people around to walk into the shot.&nbsp; This area appealed to me because there were lots of graphic elements that would make the images interesting.&nbsp; I particularly liked the reflective surfaces and the way the light was hitting them, creating vivid colors.&nbsp; I took photos to keep track of the colors, graphic elements and possible shooting angles so that I could refer back to them while arranging the model and the styling.&nbsp; I also noted the time of day when the light would be in my favor. &nbsp;<br /><br />The next step is to cast your model.&nbsp; Sometimes a great way to start is with the model first as they often have a distinct style that requires little transformation.&nbsp; Other times you will have your idea in mind and will need to look for just the right model who you think can pull it off.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />If you live in an area with fashion stylists and make-up artists you can approach them and ask them if they would be interested in collaborating on this creative project with you.&nbsp; They must also work on their own portfolios and it is a great way for everyone to grow their books and learn in the process.&nbsp; When those artists are not available, you can style the model yourself, noting the clothing and shoes sizes and perhaps having the model bring specific items to the shoot.&nbsp; I asked my stylist to bring short dresses and high heel shoes in graphic prints and solid colors as I wanted to show the model&rsquo;s long legs, arms and neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I showed the stylist my simple location images to give an idea of the possible backgrounds.<br /><br />Make-up artists can add a high-fashion element to a photo shoot.&nbsp; Collaboration can bring lots of ideas to a production but it is important that everyone is on the same page and that the styling, the model the location, and the hair and make-up all compliment each other.&nbsp; If not, the shoot will look amateur.&nbsp; Planning ahead and sharing inspirations helps to keep everyone on the same page and with the same vision in mind.&nbsp; Some models, if shown image examples, can replicate looks on themselves and this can really help if make-up and hair artists are not available.&nbsp; Be informed about what is in style at the moment both with fashion and beauty so that you don&rsquo;t look like you are unaware of what is happening in the editorial and advertising world.</p>\r\n<p>The location we used below lent itself to making graphic images: tile work on the ground, curved glass, colored windows, and interesting metal features.&nbsp; It also made a juxtaposition between the model and the background.&nbsp; She is quite feminine and yet the background is urban and a bit cold.&nbsp; I kept the color tones relatively cool to make her pop even more from the background.&nbsp; The contrast between the model and her environment is eye-catching and shows off the styling.&nbsp; Sometimes taking the fashion out of the obvious context makes for a more memorable image.&nbsp; It is less literal and shows creativity and your evolving vision.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}<br /><br />Time to shoot!&nbsp; You have your model, your styling and make-up and hair sorted out and all systems are go.&nbsp; Everyone knows the plan and are working together to make some magic.&nbsp; For our shoot, we prepared the model at home and brought the clothes to change into on set.&nbsp; We began at ten in the morning on a sunny day and shot for three hours, including time for the model to change, for the hair and make-up to be adjusted, etc. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br />It is important to always make the model long and lean without distorting or deforming her so I used angles for emphasis on her long legs.&nbsp; In the image with the red dress, she is sitting on the ground with her legs at an angle in the shot. I am standing on a ledge shooting down on her with a 50mm lens, the sun being almost on top of her as it was about eleven o&rsquo;clock, and we put a silver reflector in front of her to fill in the shadows.&nbsp; I also angled her on the black and white tile pattern on the ground so that the tiles would sweep through the image rather than be horizontal stripes.&nbsp; It really makes the red dress pop out of the shot and the eyes are drawn down her legs to the black shoes anchoring the image in the bottom right corner. &nbsp;<br /><br />Movement is a great way to make an image dynamic and visually interesting.&nbsp; My model is graceful so I got her to repeat a simple long stride as if she is jumping out of the glass sculpture.&nbsp; I made sure her left foot did not go out of the frame completely.&nbsp; I sat on the ground and used my 24mm-70mm lens set at 40mm, so I was about six feet away from her shooting up.&nbsp; The tile on the ground was very bright so we didn&rsquo;t need to use a reflector for bounce.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are shooting in shade or on a grey day, a small fill flash can do wonders for this type of movement shot.&nbsp; I asked her to remember to model with all of her body and face, being aware of her expression, arms and hand gestures, and opening her shoulder to the camera so we could see more of her.&nbsp; If her right arm was leading we would not be able to see her dress well and if her left leg was leading we might have gotten an eye full as the dress was quite short.&nbsp; Another thing to keep in mind is that you want to capture the model before her leading foot hits the ground as gravity pushes all of the body on to that foot and makes things look really heavy, even with a skinny model.&nbsp; Try to capture her just as she is about to land and you will have long limbs, graceful movements and a light and energetic feeling to the image. &nbsp;<br /><br />We wanted to capture a beauty shot of our model (below) to show her make-up and long neck so we used a reflective window surface.&nbsp;&nbsp; I used my 85mm lens and a silver reflector and placed her quite close to the surface of the window.&nbsp; Her reflection added interest to the shot and in keeping with the other images we had already done, I asked her to not look into the lens but into the window, which told more of story.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}<br /><br />In post-production when I had edited my selected images, I made sure the color balance of the skin tone was consistent and removed any small blemishes on her skin that would be very apparent.&nbsp; It is important to shoot as correctly as you can in-camera so that you don&rsquo;t shoot randomly and rely on fixing things later in post-production.&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t mean you shouldn&rsquo;t use software to save a shot that is a favorite but the light wasn&rsquo;t perfect or there was a tree or person in the shot that can be removed.&nbsp; Just make sure the image is created more in the camera than on the computer later or you will spend more time retouching than shooting.&nbsp; There are fashion image hybrid trends where everything is extremely manipulated but it still has to start with an actual image and for that you have to be a photographer first.</p>',0,3,'The-Golden-Temple.jpg','image/jpeg',63921,'2015-05-08 07:59:17',NULL,'2015-05-08 07:59:18','2015-05-08 07:59:18'),(232,74,'Lighting Techniques - Photographic Range',NULL,'<p>Sometimes, weather or available locations, dictates we shoot either in a studio or in an interior location.&nbsp; This can work in your favor as it will show range of lighting technique in your portfolio, and means that you are not limited by your surroundings.&nbsp; As you know, many fashion editorials are shot in studio and it puts the focus more directly on the model, the make-up and the styling, For models, this provides a clean, simple background from which they can show their ability to move in front of the camera, adding some drama or interest to an otherwise plain environment.&nbsp; In places where the weather is cold or dark, this is a great way for models and photographers to work on their books indoors, either in a setting with windows and natural light, or in a studio set-up.</p>\r\n<p>Model tests done in studio can be styled very simply, using the model&rsquo;s own clothes.&nbsp; The make-up and hair should stay natural, putting focus directly on the model&rsquo;s &ldquo;look&rdquo; and ability to be expressive with her eyes and body movements.&nbsp; The makeup and styling should not be distracting.&nbsp; A model and photographer can use this sort of portraiture for a long time in their portfolios as long as the clothing and hair stay current and classic.&nbsp; Keep in mind that long limbs, beautiful expressions in the eyes, and graceful body gestures will be what the agency is looking for in the images.&nbsp; The models in my own examples are wearing simple things like jeans, tank tops, shorts, sweaters and slips.&nbsp; Even though some shots show lingerie, it is tasteful and not overtly sexy in any way.</p>\r\n<p>Black and white images tend to have a more editorial quality for models and fashion, and can often hide shortcomings or distractions of the location.&nbsp; It also allows you to play with the lighting and shadows to give visual interest.&nbsp; Building a book showing a variety of lighting in studio or on location can open doors for fashion editorial assignments, and prepare you for projects where you might be thrown into an environment and expected to pull off a great fashion story, working with whatever elements you have at hand.&nbsp; It also gives you the technical tools needed to further a fashion photography career where studio photographers develop unique lighting styles to differentiate themselves from others.</p>\r\n<p>Take a look around you for a space where you could set up a small studio, or for rooms where the available light is pleasing.&nbsp; In some cities testing photographers use their apartment windows, friend&rsquo;s apartment windows, corridors, garages, etc., to do shots with local models.&nbsp; The most important element is to use the light in a way that you can control how it falls on the model, to minimize the visual distractions of the background, and to have white panels for fill when the strobes or window light isn&rsquo;t enough.</p>\r\n<p>In my first example below we shot in a friend&rsquo;s home where there was beautiful light coming in a large bedroom window.&nbsp; We added fill with a white panel to make sure the light was soft and flattering yet kept the definition in the model&rsquo;s body.&nbsp; We wanted to show the playfulness of her personality so we kept her laughing and looking away from the camera to add sweetness and fun to the image. She is sexy enough without forcing it with her facial expression or body language.&nbsp; In this case, &ldquo;natural&rdquo; was much more interesting.&nbsp; Nothing is exaggerated.&nbsp; The contrasting trim of the sweater mimicked the mats and frames of the photos on the wall behind her and added a graphic quality to the image.&nbsp; Another item that can be very useful in your home studio kit can be plain sheer white curtains or panels which can be purchased at home goods stores for very little cost.&nbsp; These can be taped over a window to act as a diffuser.&nbsp; You can also put two side by side and use them as curtains to frame the model and allow portions of light to stream through in places, keeping other areas shaded.&nbsp; They can also conceal parts of the location that are less appealing.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>In my next example, the model is wearing a simple black slip, sitting on the wooden floor of my home with a white backdrop.&nbsp; She is sitting about six feet in front of the background.&nbsp; I used one strobe directed onto a white panel, bouncing back the light onto her left side, and another white panel without a strobe on her right side to fill in the shadows.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can also play with the curves in post-production to adjust the amount of shadow you have on the model to add detail if there isn&rsquo;t enough from the white fill panel.&nbsp; You can train your eye to see at what level the shadows add drama or definition.&nbsp; Too many shadows don&rsquo;t show enough of the model&rsquo;s features and will be less useful in their portfolio.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this example, the model&rsquo;s long neck, square shoulders and symmetry worked well when she faced the camera directly.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>The following photo is of the same model. In this situation, I sat her on a wooden crate to give her some height and I placed her three feet from the backdrop.&nbsp; The image was exposed more brightly for this shot as I wanted it to be different from the previous example, showing the model in softer light.&nbsp; I directed her to use her hands in a manner that was delicate and not awkward, and to play with her eyes and expression.&nbsp; Because she has a delicacy about her I wanted to play up this vulnerability, which was a contrast from the strength of the image in the black slip dress.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>Photo examples 4 and 5 below were shot in the same home studio, this time using a bright blue paper backdrop.&nbsp; I placed the model standing six feet away from the background and I lit her using an umbrella and strobe positioned three feet away, directed down on her at a 45 degree angle, slightly towards her right side.&nbsp; This particular model had a stronger look and I wanted to play up her bone structure and angles of her face.&nbsp; I directed her in such a way as to show off her figure and hair in a voluptuous way that was in keeping with her strong look, without crossing over in to pin-up territory.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>For all the model test images that you do, keep in mind what the agency really needs to promote the model and try to fulfill that so they will continue to use you in the future.&nbsp; There are a few rules that are consistent throughout the industry:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>models are &ldquo;cool&rdquo;, the industry is &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and the agencies want to look cooler than their competitors and to look like they have the edge, so don&rsquo;t try to impose your own personal style on tests until you have the support of the agency behind you;</li>\r\n<li>nothing &ldquo;vulgar&rdquo; ever &ndash; no proper or legitimate agency wants to see their future top models shown in any compromising images;</li>\r\n<li>keep the model&rsquo;s age in mind and never shoot anything that isn&rsquo;t age-appropriate;</li>\r\n<li>images that have classic styling and natural hair and make-up will last a lot longer in the portfolio than a trendy shot;</li>\r\n<li>every image you give to the model and agency is a direct reflection back on you and your taste level so make certain you only give them your best work &ndash; when in doubt, leave it out &ndash; edit;</li>\r\n<li>be informed:&nbsp; look online and in magazines for the best in fashion photography.&nbsp; Know the top magazines and photographers and analyze their images.&nbsp; Educate yourself on the designers, brands and top fashion markets.&nbsp; Have these references, old and new, in your head at all times so that you can use what you have learned to grow your portfolio and develop your own personal style, each time you shoot.&nbsp; Tests are the training ground for fashion and beauty photographers so this is your time to learn.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>When you have seven or eight really good test images in your book that you have done with a new model or gorgeous friend you can present them to local agencies.&nbsp; Keep in mind that in the main fashion markets there are a lot of photographers ready to test models and it is much more competitive. Have something you can leave behind such a business card with a small photo on it, or a postcard size promotional card that you can give to agencies or post to billboards in local areas where young people go.&nbsp; Choose an image that is graphic and general and will appeal to a large demographic.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t list your fees or such details on the card, but direct people to call or email you for further information.&nbsp; List your website if you have one.</p>\r\n<p>Agencies will typically expect to receive a disc within three to four days with large jpegs, not retouched, and a few selects of your choice already retouched.&nbsp; Models&rsquo; portfolios are usually up to twelve inches tall by nine inches wide so the images must be at least that size and at 300dpi.&nbsp; I shoot four looks on a typical test, giving the agency about one hundred edits, and five retouched selects.&nbsp; If they choose to retouch other images on their own, the jpegs are large enough to do so.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>',0,4,'Varanasi-Ghats.jpg','image/jpeg',77302,'2015-05-08 07:59:54',NULL,'2015-05-08 07:59:55','2015-05-08 07:59:55'),(233,75,'lesson1 antartica',NULL,'<p><span style=\"color: #292727;

Good to have you aboard!&nbsp; Over the next four weeks we\'ll be covering a lot of ground as far as learning to use your digital slr camera is concerned.&nbsp; But the journey won\'t be solely \"technical.\"&nbsp; We\'ll cover the basics of digital camera craft and have fun throughout applying what\'s been learned.&nbsp; So let\'s get started!</p>\r\n<p>Cameras put to use photographing news events, taking family photos and snapping pics of family pets have changed over the years.&nbsp; From hobbyists to professionals, there\'s been a healthy market interest to push for cameras that are smaller, faster and better.&nbsp; Thus innovation in the camera market has been rapid.&nbsp; And if you\'re a true enthusiast of photography, you\'ll probably consider the camera you buy today to be obsolete in a matter of a few years.&nbsp; At least that\'s what camera manufacturers are banking on. The big manufacturers continue to develop new features to tempt photographers away from their current camera choice - and the competition is fierce.</p>\r\n<p>One innovation that stands out in the evolution of 35mm photography is the introduction of the <em>SLR</em>, or single-lens reflex camera.&nbsp; A mirror and prism were its key mechanisms.&nbsp; It worked in a way that the image seen through the viewfinder was more accurate than the one that would, in fact, be captured on film. This camera design was then, of course, followed by the <em>DSLR</em>, or digital single-lens reflex camera.&nbsp; The DSLR boasted the same technology, but recorded the image \"digitally\" on a \"sensor\" (below), rather than on film\'s chemical emulsion.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Today, there\'s no shortage of \"digicams\" on the market.&nbsp; Interestingly, photo \"apps\" such as <em>Instagram</em> &mdash; sometimes said to glorify poor photography by adding an easy filter &mdash; have renewed people\'s interest in actually taking good pictures. The question then is, where to start?</p>\r\n<p>If you haven\'t used a DSLR before or just becoming acquainted with yours now, you may not be familiar with the technology that makes it different &mdash; what makes it the preferred camera for experienced photographers and amateurs, alike. Some components include the optical viewfinder and interchangeable lenses. Digital cameras in general utilize lots of interesting technology, but we\'ll focus on a few key pieces that make them different.</p>\r\n<p>Unlike an SLR, a DSLR will often have two viewfinders &mdash; a digital display (below) which is also used for menus or to view photos already taken, and the traditional optical viewfinder, which represents the main selling point of an SLR over cameras that came before it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2)</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In an SLR or DSLR, the optical viewfinder or eyepiece offers the most accurate optical preview so the photographer can be confident the photo is framed well and the lighting is correct before he or she snaps a shot. It\'s nearly the same as the image that is captured.&nbsp; So, when you line up the shot, the light enters through the lens (which is removable and interchangeable). Light is reflected twice before becoming what you see through the viewfinder. The first time it is reflected off the mirror, and the second time, it is reflected off a <em>pentaprism</em>. A pentaprism (see below) is used in the viewfinder to reflect an image at a right angle without reversing it. It has five sides to deviate a beam of light and is used in higher-end (\"prosumer\" and professional) DSLRs.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>When the picture is taken, the mirror moves, which causes the viewfinder to go black momentarily, so the light can shine directly onto the sensor that takes the picture (in an SLR, the light would have hit the film).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pixels</strong></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\"Pixels\" are the \"grammatical\" building blocks of digital camera sensors.&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">\"Pixel\" is a contraction of the term <em><strong>PI</strong>cture <strong>EL</strong>ement</em>. Digital images are made up of small squares, just like a tile mosaic on your kitchen or bathroom wall. Though a digital photograph looks smooth and continuous just like a regular photograph, it\'s actually composed of millions of tiny squares as seen in the cut-out below.</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #888888;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">{attachment5}<strong><br /></strong></span></span></p>\r\n<p>Each pixel in the image has a numerical value of between 0 and 255 and is made up of three color channels - red, green and blue.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Megapixels &amp; Resolution</strong></p>\r\n<p>If there is one thing that the average camera user knows about, it\'s megapixel count. Loved by the beginner, the amount of pixels on a camera&rsquo;s sensor determines the amount of data that can be captured.</p>\r\n<p>So what do megapixels actually mean?&nbsp; Each &ldquo;megapixel&rdquo; is a million pixels capable of capturing bits of color that will result in an image. Let&rsquo;s take a example file (below) from a major camera brand, for example. The maximum resolution of a file produced by this particular camera\'s sensor is 4288 x 2848. On the long side of an image are 4,288 pixels, while the shorter side has 2,848 pixels. If we multiply 4288&times;2848, the resulting number is 12.2 million. So this particular dslr\'s megapixel count is 12.2 megapixels.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}<br /><br />While megapixels are a valuable measurement of a camera sensor&rsquo;s capabilities, more megapixels is not always better. One reason that camera companies have somewhat capped the number of megapixels that they will put into a sensor, is that more megapixels usually means higher levels of digital \"noise.\"&nbsp; In film terms, this equates with film \"grain.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There is also a law of diminishing returns associated with the number of pixels on a sensor. Digital cameras have been able to produce large print sizes for years with 6 or fewer megapixels. This isn&rsquo;t going to change &ndash; any camera that you&rsquo;re going to buy today is now capable of producing large prints. However, before upgrading to that new 24-megapixel camera model, ask yourself what you will use that massive resolution for. While professionals may need huge amounts of resolution for their purposes (mainly to crop what they don\'t want from original captures), if you&rsquo;re just getting started with digital photography, it\'s best to not buy into the megapixel myth that \"more is more.\"</p>\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, having the extra resolution for cropping is great. Just don&rsquo;t purchase one camera over another for megapixels alone.&nbsp; In conclusion, megapixels are a measure of only one of a digicam&rsquo;s capabilities.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Noise &amp; Sensor Sensitivity</strong></p>\r\n<p>A camera&rsquo;s &ldquo;ISO&rdquo; settings adjust the sensitivity of the sensor to light. In the film camera days, the ISO (earlier referred to as \"ASA\") was associated with the film you loaded in the camera and could not be changed. Digital sensors have the advantage of being adjustable from shot to shot, a great convenience when you\'re moving from outdoors to indoors and back.</p>\r\n<p>You may know that when you are in low light, you should consider bumping up the ISO to accommodate a usable shutter speed (too low a shutter speed - e.g. 1/15 sec and lower - you run greater risk of camera shake).&nbsp; A photographer friend once asked me why it\'s not beneficial to always set a high ISO, since doing so allows greater capture of light.&nbsp; Wouldn\'t this be the same as a super \"fast\" lens (ie. a lens capable of opening up to f2.0 or even f1.8) or a slower shutter speed (ie. allowing more time for light to hit the sensor / we\'ll talk more about \"exposure\" in the next lesson)?</p>\r\n<p>He had it correct in thinking that this was the case.&nbsp; In fact, raising the ISO does allow for more shutter speed or aperture flexibility - more room for exposure choice.&nbsp; However, this comes at a cost. High ISO settings allow for faster shutter speeds in low light, but introduce digital noise (\"grain\" in film terms) into the image.&nbsp; A camera&rsquo;s sensor works best at the lowest ISO setting (e.g. ISO 100 or 200).&nbsp; At these settings, you&rsquo;re going to see the best colors, lowest amount of noise and overall highest image quality.&nbsp; Low ISO settings produce the cleanest image but require lots of light - good clear and sunny skies outdoors and professional studio lighting indoors. Generally, you will want to use the lowest ISO setting that lighting conditions and your camera will allow.</p>\r\n<p>From sensor to sensor, ISO performance varies. One of the biggest strides in recent camera technology is the high ISO capability of modern cameras. So much so, that yesterday&rsquo;s ISO 400 is now matched in quality by today&rsquo;s ISO 800.&nbsp; The boundaries of low-light performance continue to be pushed to levels that were never before possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Sensor Size</strong></p>\r\n<p>Not all camera sensors are built equally. Each company uses their own technologies and specifications in building the latest sensors for their latest camera models. The specifications used have a great impact on the overall quality of the sensor and as a result, the images made with it.</p>\r\n<p>One of the major factors that determines image quality is the physical size of a sensor. This is why a DSLR is going to produce better images than almost any point-and-shoot camera.&nbsp; The size of the sensor in a pocket-sized camera is merely a fraction of its SLR counterpart.&nbsp; Typically, larger sensors will also perform better in high ISO situations &ndash; an effect that can certainly be witnessed when comparing point-and-shoots to even entry-level DSLR&rsquo;s.&nbsp; That is, images made at high ISO settings with a point-and-shoot will exhibit far more noise than those captured with even a low price range dslr camera.</p>\r\n<p>By now, you may have heard of an effect called a &ldquo;crop factor&rdquo;.&nbsp; This term describes the size of a camera sensor in relation to a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; size.&nbsp; What is this standard size? The reference point is a &ldquo;full frame&rdquo; sensor, meaning a sensor that is the same size as a 35mm frame of film. Any sensor that is smaller than a full-frame sensor is going to experience the \"crop factor.\"<br /><br />The box below represents the area that would be captured by a full-frame sensor, while the lesser areas represent a \"crop factor\" of that camera&rsquo;s field of view.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>You may know too that to crop an image is to use a selected portion of the image, or to basically select a smaller region of the image, thus cutting away captured pixels. On a crop-factor camera, you are getting a field of view that is tighter than that of a full frame sensor.&nbsp; Now in terms lenses, crop factors have an influence too.&nbsp; For example, Canon digital slrs (excluding their full-frame models) use a 1.5 crop factor sensor.&nbsp; This means if you have a 100mm lens attached, in 35mm (full-frame) terms, this lens effectively becomes a 150mm lens (100 x 1.5).</p>\r\n<p>There are sensors larger than 35mm &ldquo;full frame&rdquo; sizes, too.&nbsp; Digital \"medium format\" is a growing field that is favored by product and studio photographers.&nbsp; These photographers favor the massive resolution (80 megapixels) that is offered by manufacturers such as, \"Phase One.\"&nbsp; And now competitors such as Mamiya and Hasselblad are close on their heels with their own versions of massive megapixel models.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Take the Controls - Modes<br /></strong></p>\r\n<p>The majority of dslrs today place camera control in one dial or a combination of buttons.&nbsp; As seen in the drawing below, the photographer is presented with a range of options when it comes to using his or her digital camera.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>The exposure modes of a dslr let you control one setting while the camera automatically adjusts the others. In Shutter Priority mode (<strong>Tv</strong>), you to set the shutter speed while the camera sets the aperture/f-stop to produce a \"proper\" exposure. In Aperture Priority mode (<strong>Av</strong>), the photographer sets the aperture/f-stop while the camera sets the shutter speed. Manual mode (<strong>M</strong>) is fully under your control to set both aperture and shutter speed, allowing for both proper exposure and maximum creativity.&nbsp; Based on light level, fully automatic mode or \"Program\" (<strong>P</strong>) makes all the decisions for you at a squeeze of the shutter button.&nbsp; It\'s fast, but this mode setting affords the photographer little room for individual creative expression.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Aperture</strong></p>\r\n<p>Aperture, or \"f-stop\", refers to how big the hole will be for the light to pass through when the shutter is open and the picture is snapped (we\'ll talk more about this in Lesson #2).&nbsp; For now, just remember that lower f-numbers correspond with larger holes.&nbsp; And, the larger the f-number, the more things in front of and behind the subject will be in focus, but the more light you will need. The smaller the f-number, the more things in front of and behind the subject will be out of focus and the less light you will need.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shutter speed</strong></p>\r\n<p>Shutter speed is how long the shutter needs to be open, allowing light into the camera, to properly expose the image. Fast shutter speeds allow you to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the action in a photo, but require lots of light. Slower shutter speeds allow for shooting with less light, but can cause motion blur in the image. The creative and expressive choice is yours.</p>\r\n<p>\"<strong>Light</strong>\" is the \"language\" of photography, be it film-based or digital.&nbsp; The basics are the same and the controls (i.e. aperture, shutter speed and ISO) are your means of creative expression with the camera.&nbsp; These and how they relate to \"exposure\" will be covered at length in Lesson #2.</p>',0,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-08 12:43:05','2015-05-08 12:43:05'),(241,78,'Exposure Explained',NULL,'<p>We touched on aspects of exposure at the end of the first lesson and we&rsquo;ll talk through it more fully in this one.&nbsp; So get ready to move your camera&rsquo;s mode dial or button away from that all-controlling &ldquo;P&rdquo; (Program) mode and on to more creative endeavors.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re going manual (&ldquo;M&rdquo;)! <br /><br />Exposure is one of the first - and one of the most confusing - concepts for newcomers to photography.&nbsp; All the numbers, settings, abbreviations and relationships can be quite daunting at first, but once they&rsquo;re mastered, you&rsquo;ll fully understand just what the other modes offered by your camera are doing for you when they\'re set.<br /><br /><strong>ISO</strong>, s<strong>hutter speed</strong> and a<strong>perture</strong> -&nbsp; these are the components of photographic exposure (diagram below) and the relationship between them is a dynamic one.&nbsp; That is, when one of these component settings is changed, the two others are affected, too.&nbsp; Together, the three work to create a properly exposed photograph.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s run through this briefly again.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}<br /><br /><strong>ISO</strong> is a measurement of the digital camera sensor&rsquo;s sensitivity to light (with film, this equates to the chemical emulsion&rsquo;s sensitivity to light striking it).&nbsp; ISO commonly ranges from 100 to 1600, with many cameras going as low as 50 and as high as 6400 and more. An ISO rating of 100 is less sensitive to light than an ISO rating of 800. The former would be used in brightly-lit circumstances (sunny day with no clouds or indoors using studio lights) in order to prevent overexposure. The latter would be used in low-light conditions (cloudy day or indoors in low light) to prevent the photo from being underexposed.<br /><br /><strong>Shutter speed</strong> refers to the length of time the shutter remains open to expose the camera&rsquo;s sensor to light and create the image. Shutter speeds on most cameras range from 1/8000th of a second down to a full minute and more.&nbsp; In practice, you&rsquo;ll want to use a fast shutter speed in bright light to avoid overexposing your photo.&nbsp; Conversely, you should set a slow shutter speed in dim light to keep your picture from underexposing.&nbsp; Note here that a shutter speed of 1/30 sec. is about as low as you might want to go before camera shake starts to become an issue.<br /><br /><strong>Aperture</strong>, also referred to as &ldquo;f-stop&rdquo;, refers to the size of the lens opening when the picture is taken.&nbsp; Apertures range from f/1.8 (large opening) to f/22 (small opening).&nbsp; The larger the aperture, the more light is allowed into the camera to create the image. Some lenses offer an aperture of f/1.4 or even f/1.2, which allow even more light to reach the sensor when fully open.&nbsp; These lenses come at a higher price, however, both in terms of cost and weight.&nbsp; Such &ldquo;fast&rdquo; lenses, as they\'re often referred to, allow the photographer to capture images in much lower light situations.&nbsp; F-stop terminology can create confusion.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that a small number equals a large opening and a large f-stop number represents a small opening (diagram below).</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Depth of Field</strong> is the distance in front and behind that which is sharply focused on, that appears also in focus.&nbsp; And this area is dependent on the f/stop (aperture) that has been set either by the photographer or by the camera via its program modes.</p>\r\n<p>At a low f/stop (large aperture, say f/2.8) there is very little depth of field, while a high f/stop (small aperture, say f/32) exhibits much more depth of field. This can be visualized easily by photographing a row of pencils, where that closest the camera is sharply focused on.&nbsp; At f/2.8 (very shallow depth of field), only the pencil closest to the camera is in sharp focus.&nbsp; Those farther away are out of focus, \"blurred\" or \"soft.\"&nbsp; As the f-stop number becomes higher, the diaphram of the lens becomes smaller and more of the pencil arrangement comes into sharper focus, until a very small aperture diaphram results at f/32 and all pencils from near to far appear in-focus and sharply so.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>In real world terms this means that you can control the amount of your subject that will be in focus by choosing different f/stops. When photographing flat objects (objects on a single plane with no visible 3-dimensional properties), the aperture setting is not critical, for if you have the camera back parallel to the subject it will all be in focus. When you photograph a 3-D object though, you must decide which plane of the object you wish to be in focus and how you want to use depth of field. You can decide to use a shallow depth of field (low f/stop,2.8) to highlight one plane of the subject (for example, a particular pencil mid-way down the line of pencils), while blurring or softening the rest. Conversely, you may decide to have as much of the subject as possible in focus by using a high f/stop like f/32, as we\'ve seen in the pencil example below.</p>\r\n<p>Remember though - if you have less light entering the camera (through a small aperture opening), the exposure time (via shutter speed setting) must be longer in order to get a proper exposure on the image sensor.&nbsp; That is, aperture and shutter speed work in opposite directions from one another.&nbsp; Once you have established a proper exposure using your camera\'s light meter (center of drawing below establishing a perfect exposure at f/5.6 and 1/200 sec.), a step-wise change in either aperture or shutter speed requires a change - in the same number of steps of the other - in the opposite direction.&nbsp; This means (for example) if you want to soften / blur the background behind your sharply-focused subject, you might open up your lens diaphram (aperture) completely to f1.8.&nbsp; This is in this diagram example, a 2-stop change in aperture.&nbsp; To maintain perfect exposure, you will need to increase shutter speed by two \"stops\" in the opposite direction (ie. 1/800 sec.).&nbsp; This will give you the exact same \"perfect\" exposure, but with a shallow depth of field.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s now take an example where you want to blur a car passing in front of your lens.&nbsp; Your \"priority\" setting in this case would not be aperture, but instead your main consideration is shutter speed.&nbsp; To allow the car to blur at least mildly, you might choose a slower shutter speed of 1/100 sec.&nbsp; Being a 2-stop decrease in shutter speed from the original perfect exposure setting, you would need to increase aperture by 2-stops (i.e. f/8).</p>\r\n<p>On a sunny day, an ISO setting would allow you a full range of such reciprocals to choose from.&nbsp; As lightening conditions become darker, this range shrinks - choices of aperture and shutter speeds become fewer.&nbsp; The solution it to shift to the next higher ISO setting to maintain an acceptable range of settings to accomplish (in terms of depth of field, stopping and blurring action) just what you want to in your photo. As you can see, the combination of ISO, shutter speed, and aperture are all about controlling the amount of light that reaches the camera&rsquo;s sensor (or the film&rsquo;s emulsion surface).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Establishing Proper Exposure - Your Camera&rsquo;s Light Meter</strong><br /><br />In contrast to a hand-held meter that measures the amount of light falling on a scene, your in-camera light meter measures light reflected from the scene you are photographing.<br /><br />{attachment5}<br /><br />Your camera&rsquo;s light meter does have a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; to which it compares all light it reflectively measures.&nbsp; This standard is referred to as &ldquo;18 percent grey,&rdquo; a middle tone of grey (below) that equates to pointing your camera at grass, soil, your blue jeans, khaki-colored cloths or the back of your hand, in the same light as the scene you&rsquo;re about to photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}<br /><br />Furthermore, your camera&rsquo;s reflective light meter is programmed to be very strict in applying it&rsquo;s middle and average tone of grey standard.&nbsp; This means that when you are photographing a scene or subject in evenly-distributed light of &ldquo;average&rdquo; reflectance throughout (example: a person sitting in the shade of a tree on a sunny day), the light meter will acknowledge the choice and the result will be a properly exposed photo.<br /><br /><strong>Light Meter Challenge - light background / dark subject</strong><br /><br />Fine, but what if the photo is to be of a dark object against a white background?&nbsp; Well, your camera&rsquo;s light meter mission is still to maintain a standard of &ldquo;middle grey,&rdquo;&nbsp; This means that your light meter will read the entire scene, see it being much brighter than 18 percent grey and reduce exposure to bring down the white area so it meets the middle grey standard.&nbsp; <strong>RESULT</strong>: Background properly exposed / subject underexposed (too dark).<br /><br /><strong>Light Meter Challenge - dark background / light subject</strong></p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s look at the opposite situation - dark background and white or light-colored subject.&nbsp; Once again the camera&rsquo;s light meter will strive for middle-tone, 18 percent grey and an overall reading of the scene will be too dark.&nbsp; The camera light meter will strive to make the background lighter (18 percent grey), thus making the already light subject even lighter.&nbsp; <strong>RESULT:</strong> Background properly exposed / subject overexposed (too light).</p>\r\n<p><strong>In-Camera Reflective Light Meter Options </strong></p>\r\n<p>In order to accurately expose a greater range of subject lighting and reflectance combinations, most cameras feature several metering options. Each option works by assigning a weighting to different light regions; those with a higher weighting are considered more reliable, and thus contribute more to the final exposure calculation.&nbsp; In the diagram of meter types below, the whitest regions are those which contribute most towards the exposure calculation, whereas black areas are ignored.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Partial and spot-metering give the photographer far more control over the exposure than any of the other settings, but this also means that these are more difficult to use &mdash; at least initially. They are useful when there is a relatively small object within your scene which you either need to be perfectly exposed, or know that it will provide the closest match to middle grey.</p>\r\n<p>One of the most common applications of partial metering is a portrait of someone who is backlit. Metering off of their face can help avoid making the subject look like an under-exposed silhouette against the bright background. On the other hand, care should be taken as the shade of a person\'s skin may lead to inaccurate exposure if it is far from neutral grey reflectance &mdash; but probably not as inaccurate as what would have been caused by the backlighting.</p>\r\n<p>Spot-metering is used less often because its metering area is very small and thus quite specific. This can be an advantage when you are unsure of your subject\'s reflectance and have a specially designed grey card (or other small object) to meter off of.</p>\r\n<p>More sophisticated algorithms may go beyond just a regional map and include: evaluative, zone and matrix metering. These are usually the default when your camera is set to auto exposure. Each generally works by dividing the image up into numerous sub-sections, where each section is then considered in terms of its relative location, light intensity or color. The location of the autofocus point and orientation of the camera (portrait vs. landscape) may also contribute to the calculation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Exposure Compensation&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n<p>Any of the above metering modes can use a feature called exposure compensation. The metering calculation still works as normal, except the final settings are then compensated by the exposure compensation value. This allows for manual corrections if you observe a metering mode to be consistently under or over-exposing. Most cameras allow up to 2 stops of exposure compensation; each stop of exposure compensation provides either a doubling or halving of light compared to what the metering mode would have done otherwise. A setting of zero means no compensation will be applied (default).</p>\r\n<p>Exposure compensation is ideal for correcting in-camera metering errors caused by the subject\'s reflectivity. No matter what metering mode is used, an in-camera light meter will always mistakenly under-expose a subject such as a white dove in a snowstorm.&nbsp; Photographs in the snow will always require around +1 exposure compensation (due to the light meter reading the brightness of the snow and then setting out to bring it down to 18 percent grey).&nbsp; Adding (compensating) one more stop of light puts the \"white back in the white.\"&nbsp; In low-key situations (e.g. a black dog against a black background) just the opposite is required.&nbsp; The camera\'s light meter tries to bring the dark scene up to middle (18 percent) grey and in so doing, leaves the scene \"muddy\" in appearance.&nbsp; Decreasing exposure (via the compensation dial or buttons on your camera) by one stop keeps the \"black in the black.\"</p>\r\n<p>The last thing I want to cover in this lesson - and it\'s an important one, is <strong>White Balance.&nbsp; </strong>In fact, White balance (<strong>WB</strong>) is considered as one of the most important settings of a digital camera. So as example, let\'s consider a scenario where you want to capture the beauty of sea waves hitting the shore with an overcast sky in the background. Sounds interesting? Well, if you don&rsquo;t use the correct white balance setting of your digital camera, you may get a picture with colors different from the actual ones you\'re seeing. Therefore, in order to produce a beautifully exposed image with true-to-life colors, you must learn to effectively use the white balance settings of your digital camera.</p>\r\n<p>To understand the concept of White Balance, you need to first understand the concept of color temperature. Color temperature is a characteristic of visible light. It provides a method of describing these characteristics and is measured in Kelvin (K). A light having higher color temperature will have more blue light or larger Kelvin value, as compared to lower light, which has a smaller Kelvin value. The following table shows the color temperature of various sources of light.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>A digital camera can measure the colors in the red, green, and blue light of the spectrum, as reflected to its sensors. In a photo taken under the midday sun there is the whole spectrum of light (which makes up &ldquo;white&rdquo; sunlight). Under these conditions, the colors in an image appear nearest to the &ldquo;true&rdquo; colors. An image taken under tungsten bulb (a normal household incandescent bulb) without adjusting the digital camera for white balance, produces a dull orange shade as it spreads the biased light. Similarly, an image taken under fluorescent lighting produces a brighter bluish cast. However, it is possible to shift the color in the desirable direction, provided you have a good understanding of your digital camera and its settings.</p>\r\n<p>White balance can be set manually.&nbsp; The process involves taking meter readings from a pure white card in the same light where shooting is to be done.&nbsp; This is laborious, since the photographer must do this each time lighting conditions change.&nbsp; Fortunately, digital cameras today have white balance <strong>presets</strong> that are icon-defined on a dial or in a screen menu of your camera (below).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>These are usually indicated as:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Auto</strong> &ndash; The Auto setting helps in adjusting the white balance automatically according to the different lighting conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Tungsten</strong> &ndash; This mode is used for lighting with regular light bulbs found in every home.&nbsp; The tungsten setting of the digital camera cools down the color temperature in photos.<br /><br /><strong>Fluorescent</strong> &ndash; This mode is used for getting brighter and warmer shots while compensating for the cool shade of fluorescent light.<br /><br /><strong>Daylight</strong> &ndash; This mode is for the normal daylight setting, while shooting outdoors. Many cameras do not have the Daylight mode.<br /><br /><strong>Cloudy</strong> &ndash; This mode is ideal for shooting on a cloudy day. This is because it warms up the subject and surroundings and allows you to capture better shots.<br /><br /><strong>Flash</strong> &ndash; The flash mode is required when there is inadequate lighting available. This mode helps pick the right White Balance under low light conditions.<br /><br /><strong>Shade</strong> &ndash; A shaded location generally produces cooler or bluer pictures, hence you need to warm up the surroundings while shooting shaded objects.</p>\r\n<p>Granted<strong> - </strong>we\'ve covered a lot here, but it should give you a solid knowledge of just how your digital camera works and \"thinks.\"&nbsp; With this know-how and the technical expertise of your digicam, you\'ll be equipped to express yourself freely and more confidently as a photographer<strong>.</strong></p>',0,2,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-08 12:44:12','2015-05-08 13:14:18'),(242,78,'Composition and Light',NULL,'<p>In photography - digital or film - it&rsquo;s not only what you photograph that matters, it&rsquo;s the way you photograph your subject, as well.&nbsp; A badly composed photograph can turn a great scene into a very dull one.&nbsp; At the same time, a well composed photo can make even the most ordinary of subjects come alive.</p>\r\n<p>When I was starting out in photography, I viewed composition as something obscure - almost akin to \"magic.\"&nbsp; I really had no idea where to start with this.&nbsp; But the more I worked with my photography, the more I came to realize that composition doesn&rsquo;t have to be complicated.&nbsp; There are all sorts of theories about how a photograph should be arranged and many of these so-called, \"rules,\" go clear back to early Greek times and their ideas of proportion, symmetry and the like.&nbsp; Truth is though, if you pay&nbsp;too much attention to strict formulas such as these, your photos will lose any kind&nbsp;of spontaneity and that does take the \"magic\" out of your work.</p>\r\n<p>In the real world, you&rsquo;ll be working with a&nbsp;wide range of scenes and subjects and&nbsp;this calls for a more open-minded approach to how elements within the frame should be presented. What works for one photograph, won&rsquo;t necessarily work for another.&nbsp; The key thing is to understand how all the decisions you make about composition can affect the way a picture looks and how people view and interpret the photographs you make.&nbsp; The way you frame a shot, choose a focal length of lens or position a subject within the frame, can make all the difference.</p>\r\n<p>One of the first pointers I did put to work when starting in photography is to avoid placing the subject smack-dab in the middle of the frame.&nbsp; It seems the natural thing to do when you\'re just beginning.&nbsp; The result though is a rather static and boring look to the photo.&nbsp; One of the ways to counteract this is to bring the so-called, \"Rule of Thirds,\" into play.&nbsp; The idea is to divide the scene (your viewfinder) into thirds, vertically and horizontally, as in the diagram below.&nbsp; One of the four intersections of imaginary lines is then is a good place to position your subject.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that this is just a \"guideline.\"&nbsp; Fact is, it is too strictly adhered to much too often in photography.&nbsp; Perhaps a more casual variant of this guideline is to simply position your subject away from the center, as I\'ve done in the next shot made in a tropical Nairobi (Kenya).&nbsp; From here you can then get a \"feel\" for how it can be balanced with everything else in the scene.&nbsp; No rules or guidelines for achieving this balance either.&nbsp; The more you work with it, the quicker you simply develop an instinct for when something just looks right.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Keep it Simple - </strong>Simplicity is more times than not, key to a strong and pleasing photograph.&nbsp; Looking at a scene with the naked eye, your brain quickly zooms in on the main point of interest.&nbsp; In contrast, the camera goes through no such process, it captures everything in front of it.&nbsp; The result can be a messy, cluttered picture with no clear center of interest - no place for the viewer\'s eye to focus on, as in the backyard garden example that follows.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>What is needed is to choose a subject, then select a lens focal length or camera perspective that defines a center of attention within the frame, as I\'ve done with the next photo of brightly-colored flowers present in this garden scene.&nbsp; Distractions will often be present, but it\'s you job to keep them in the background as best you can or simply make them part of the story if their \"fit\" is in any way possible.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Fill the Frame -</strong> When you&rsquo;re shooting a large-scale scene it can be difficult to know just how large your subject should be within the frame.&nbsp; How much should you zoom in?&nbsp; Leaving too much empty space (\"negative space\") in your photo is something you don\'t want to do either.&nbsp; It makes your subject smaller than it needs to be and can also leave viewers confused about what they should be looking at.&nbsp; So you don\'t have problems with this, zoom in either with your lens or simply move closer to the subject when and where possible.&nbsp; Zooming in from a fixed camera position flattens the perspective of the shot and makes it easier to control or remove unwanted elements in the background.&nbsp; However, physically moving closer can result in a much more interesting picture, as with the shot below made of a group of school girls strolling on a beach in South India.&nbsp; I simply moved in close until the composition felt \"right\" and I was rewarded throughout the frame with these brilliant smiles.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Leading lines -</strong> A poorly composed photograph will leave your viewers unsure about where to look, and their attention might drift aimlessly around the scene without finding a clear focal point. However, you can use lines to control the way people&rsquo;s eyes move around the picture, taking them to a subject - a focal point in the distance.&nbsp; Converging lines give a strong&nbsp;sense of perspective and&nbsp;three-dimensional depth, drawing you into an image, as do the abandoned train tracks in the harbor area of Dusseldorf, Germany.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Curved lines like that of the stream below can lead you on a&nbsp;journey around the frame, taking you towards the main subject, here being a foot-bridge in a village park.&nbsp; Lines exist everywhere, in the form of walls, fences, roads, buildings and telephone wires. They can also be implied, perhaps by the direction in which an off-centre subject is&nbsp;looking.&nbsp; When photos contain a strong line, it&rsquo;s almost impossible for your eye not to follow it.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}<br /><br /><strong>Use diagonals -</strong> Horizontal lines lend a static,&nbsp;calm feel to a picture, while vertical ones&nbsp;often suggest permanence and stability. To introduce a feeling of drama, movement or uncertainty, look for diagonal lines to create a strong sense of movement and force.</p>\r\n<p>Often all it takes is a change of camera position or focal length to get them.&nbsp; Wider angles of view tend to introduce diagonal lines due to the increased perspective.&nbsp; By using wide angle lenses, you\'re much more likely to tilt the camera up or down to fit more of the scene into the frame and this automatically creates diagonals.&nbsp; Diagonal lines can also be created artificially, by simply tilting the camera before squeezing the shutter button, as I have done from a low camera angle in my capture of a performing artist in the Old City of Fez, Morocco, below.&nbsp; This technique can be very effective, but photographers should be alerted to use it carefully and sparingly.&nbsp; Intentional camera tilt doesn\'t fit to every shot you make.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Diagonal lines don\'t need to be tangible, either.&nbsp; They can be imagined, as in the next photo showing a girl looking down with pride at her baby sister next to her on the sofa.&nbsp; This line-of-sight, too, represents a diagonal line adding dynamism to this picture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Space to move -</strong> Even though photographs themselves are static, they can still convey a strong sense of movement.&nbsp; When we look at pictures, we&nbsp;see what&rsquo;s happening and tend to look&nbsp;ahead &ndash; this creates a feeling of imbalance or unease if your subject has nowhere to move except out of the frame, as with the Italian monk below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>Your compositions will be much more effective if you leave space for the action to move \"into,\" as I\'ve done with this young girl running on a beach in Kerala, India.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>This effect doesn\'t just apply to moving subjects, either.&nbsp; For example, when you look at a portrait you tend to follow someone&rsquo;s gaze and they too need an area to&nbsp;look \"into.\"&nbsp; Compare the two photographs below, for example, second of which lends a more stable \"feel.\"&nbsp; With the subject looking out of the frame, the feel is one of \"on edge\" and discomfort - and this is the point.&nbsp; Don\'t misunderstand this difference, though.&nbsp; Both have there effect - their place in photography.&nbsp; I just depends on the message the photographer wants to send to the viewer.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment12}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment13}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Backgrounds -</strong> Don&rsquo;t just concentrate on your&nbsp;subject &ndash; look at what&rsquo;s happening in the background, too. This ties in with <em>simplifying the scene</em> and <em>filling the frame</em>. You can&rsquo;t usually exclude the background completely, of course, but you can control it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll often find that changing your position is enough to replace an unwanted background that nicely complements your subject.&nbsp; Or&nbsp;you can use a wide lens aperture and&nbsp;a&nbsp;longer focal length to soften the background, by throwing it completely out of focus, as in the photo of a majestic Afghan hound standing on a beach, below.&nbsp; Using this technique not only \"nullifies\" the background, it places added emphasis on a sharply in-focus subject at the same time.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment14}</p>\r\n<p><strong>Creative with colours -</strong> Bright primary colors really attract the eye, especially when they&rsquo;re contrasted with a complementary hue.&nbsp; Complementary colors are those that lie opposite each other on the color wheel. Orange and blue, for example, are complimentary colors, as are red and green and yellow and violet. Such color combinations add contrast and visual excitement to the photographic frame.&nbsp; And scenes consisting almost entirely of a single hue can be very effective, as well.&nbsp; Take for example the walls and stairs of orange in a New Delhi, India park presented below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment15}</p>\r\n<p>The key to color is to be really selective about how you isolate and frame your subjects to exclude unwanted colours.&nbsp; Simplicity reins supreme in this arena, also.&nbsp; Two or three colors of related hue deliver the strongest color photographs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Breaking the rules -</strong> In summary, photo composition is a little like a visual language &ndash; you can use it to make your pictures communicate a specific message.&nbsp; However, just as we sometimes use the written word to create a deliberately surprising effect, we&nbsp;can do the same with photos by breaking with standard composition conventions.<br />Doing&nbsp;it by&nbsp;accident doesn&rsquo;t count, though! It&rsquo;s&nbsp;when you understand the rules of composition and then break them on purpose that things start to get interesting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s often best to break one rule at time and look closely at the results.</p>\r\n<p>Just&nbsp;remember: for every rule we suggest, somewhere out there is&nbsp;a great picture that proves you can disregard it and still produce a&nbsp;fantastic image!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Light - </strong>Photography is all about light and without any kind of it, you&rsquo;d not be very successful with making a photograph.&nbsp; Understanding how to use light, manipulate it and incorporate it into the photos you capture is the most important aspect of photography that you&rsquo;ll learn. Once you understand light and how it affects your pictures, you&rsquo;ll be way ahead of most beginning photographers.</p>\r\n<p>Part of learning about lighting is getting the hang of the three main different angles: front light, side light, and back light.&nbsp; As with most photo scenarios, the subject matter you choose is important.&nbsp; Front-, side- and back-lighting a person for a portrait takes a different thought process than it does for landscapes,fine art or commercial photography. No matter what your subject is though, master lighting and you&rsquo;ll be on your way to becoming a pro.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Front Light - </strong>Front light is the easiest illumination angle you&rsquo;ll work as a photographer.&nbsp; Results are the most predictable when light is striking subjects straight on.&nbsp; It is also the least dramatic type of light you\'ll photograph your subjects in.&nbsp; More times than not you\'ll get good results with front lighting.&nbsp; And as in the casual portrait below, colors are at their brightest and there are fewer shadows to deal with than other types of lighting.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment16}</p>\r\n<p>Down-side to using front lighting is that it makes subjects appear flat, which can result in boring photos.&nbsp; Thus creativity is at its lowest when front lighting is brought into play.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Side Light - </strong>If you want to explore the creative, dramatic side of photography, side lighting is the way to do it.&nbsp; Side lighting visually defines the subject from its background.&nbsp; Thus it&rsquo;s the perfect light for emphasizing texture, defining depth, and bringing out patterns. For these reasons, both nature and landscape photographers regularly put side lighting to use for its limited palette of harmonious shades and soft lighting effect.&nbsp; Take for example the following photo made amid the mountainous landscape of Ladakh in northern India.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment17}</p>\r\n<p>When you side light a subject, its texture pops. And side lighting is more effective with portraits because it helps you emphasize the emotion and depth of your subject in a more dramatic way, such as the image of this woman below, looking out of a window.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment18}</p>\r\n<p>Down sides to side-lit subjects are few.&nbsp; One being that too much contrast in a photo can be unflattering.&nbsp; In these cases, the use of a reflector to bounce in additional light or the use of \"fill flash\" can be put to work to reduce any contrast that\'s present.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Back Light - </strong>Back lighting is one of the most popular lighting options for creating drama. Back light is when the sun or other light source comes from behind your subject - which means you&rsquo;re shooting into the light.&nbsp; Back light is undoubtedly the trickiest to use, but when it\'s used properly, the results can be stunning.</p>\r\n<p>The most popular backlit images tend to be people in nature like the sailor below, out on the water on a sunny afternoon.&nbsp; Nature scenes too are likely subjects for back lighting effect, as with this group of ferns in a forest, that follows.&nbsp; And just as with side lighting, backlit images emphasize contrasting depth in the scene, as well.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment19}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment20}</p>\r\n<p>So there you have it, the \"building blocks\" of all types of photography.&nbsp; Learn compositional rules and guidelines, apply them where they fit and once you\'ve mastered them, boldly break them to express your own creativity and style.&nbsp; But don\'t forget the light.&nbsp; It\'s rules don\'t change.&nbsp; Practice shooting at different times of the day and use direction of light to your best advantage - to express who you are as a photographer.</p>',0,3,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-08 12:45:10','2015-05-08 13:17:07'),(243,78,'From Snapshots to Photographs',NULL,'<p>Lessons 1 through 3 have given you a pretty good idea (including practice) of what photography and digital photography in particular, is all about.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve looked at camera controls and functions, discussed how elements are arranged within the frame and how to light them.&nbsp; Now it\'s time to put together this information and skills and take some fantastic digital photographs of your own.</p>\r\n<p>Before we start though, let\'s make a distinction between two very different categories of photographic capture - between so-called, \"snapshots\" and \"photographs.\"&nbsp; The distinction may seem trivial, but as you grow as a photographer, you\'ll see that the difference is significant and you\'ll know when you\'re making one or the other.</p>\r\n<p>Wikipedia defines a \"snapshot\" as \"a photograph that is \"shot\" spontaneously and quickly, most often without artistic or journalistic intent. Snapshots are commonly considered to be technically \"imperfect\" or amateurish&mdash;out of focus or poorly framed or composed. Common snapshot subjects include the events of everyday life, such as birthday parties and other celebrations, sunsets, children playing, group photos, pets, tourist attractions and the like.\"</p>\r\n<p>OK - I agree in part, but subjects here can be equally stunning and meaningful when shot as \"photographs.\"&nbsp; I also agree that snapshots tend to be quick and \"rough\" captures aimed primarily at being a \"document\" of a scene or event.&nbsp; In contrast, a \"photograph\" is a well thought through capture of a scene or event that is pleasantly and effectively composed, exposed and intended to be a form of art.</p>\r\n<p>Now - taking this rather academic description of the two into account, let\'s put them both into practice with some examples.&nbsp; And let\'s start with an everyday garden scene, captured as a snapshot in the image below.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment1}</p>\r\n<p>Given what we\'ve covered to date, an analysis of this images reveals no real \"subject,\" other than the whole scene itself.&nbsp; There\'s no photographer-defined element for the viewer\'s eyes to settle on.&nbsp; The image contains nice colors, but when you notice the lighting situation, it\'s very \"contrasty,\" meaning that both very strong light and deep shadows exist in the frame.&nbsp; Make a note here that it\'s always best to stay with one type of light or the other - all full sunlight or all \"open shade\" conditions (low-key, yet warm and filtered sunlight), as exist in the shade of the tree in this frame.</p>\r\n<p>In the next frame you\'ll notice a transformation starting to occur.&nbsp; A few steps closer and a \"subject\" begins to be defined in the form of the tree and the birdhouse that hangs from its trunk.&nbsp; Notice too the position of the tree.&nbsp; It\'s not positioned dead-center, but slightly off-center making for a more pleasing composition.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment2}</p>\r\n<p>Enter the third of this garden series (below).&nbsp; Here the photographer has moved even closer to clearly define the subject of this composition to be the birdhouse itself.&nbsp; But not only proximity suggests this, the house is positioned roughly rule-of-thirds within the frame, possesses sharp focus and a wide aperture setting has been used to soften the background and place even greater emphasis on the intended subject.&nbsp; Snapshot?&nbsp; Photograph?&nbsp; This three-photo example should make it clear that starting with an undefined pull-up-and-shoot \"document\" of a garden scene, the photographer has used light, compositional guidelines and essential elements to capture a \"photograph\" that is pleasing to look at in terms of its design.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment3}</p>\r\n<p>The next two examples take this process to the next level.&nbsp; The first of two images below is already in \"photograph\" form.&nbsp; \"Subject\" of this composition lies on the left of the frame in the form of the songbook held by the conductor of this about-to-perform group of singers and musicians.&nbsp; What ties subject and background together here is the songbook repeatedly present throughout the frame.&nbsp; The fact that both subject and background appear in sharp focus (great depth of field created by a large f-stop number / small aperture opening) visually indicates that they are strongly related.&nbsp; To have done otherwise (ie. soft, out-of-focus background / small f-stop number / large aperture opening) would have weakened this relationship, placing greater emphasis on the sharply-in-focus man and songbook.&nbsp; Notice too that the entire scene is evenly lit by \"open shade\" type of lighting, the best for people pictures, since it creates no harsh shadows on faces.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment4}</p>\r\n<p>Second of these two photographs offers an even tighter (closer) view of this scene and a somewhat different photograph entirely.&nbsp; Subject?&nbsp; Well, it\'s noticeably the foreground girl on the right.&nbsp; And as we discussed earlier, her looking not inward, but out of the frame creates a feeling of \"tension,\" as if she is waiting and watching for the group\'s call to perform.&nbsp; Nice even light prevails and the mix of faces and songbooks keeps the eye circling through the composition.&nbsp; Thus moving closer to the scene in this situation has delivered a different message - and somewhat different feel to the photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment5}</p>\r\n<p>The next pair of images were captured digitally in the recreational boat harbor area of Dusseldorf, Germany, a location of trendy restaurants, shops and - art work.&nbsp; And the first of the two pictures below focuses on a part of this.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment6}</p>\r\n<p>Which of those compositional elements and strategies we\'ve already discussed can be identified here?&nbsp; The first can be that the frame is filled - filled with these Gumby-like figures scaling this building.&nbsp; Can a \"subject\" readily be identified?&nbsp; Take a look throughout the frame which consists of a repetition (in different colors) of similar forms and you\'ll note that the somewhat larger red one near the bottom right of the frame stand out.&nbsp; It stands out due to its relative size, but also because of its rule-of-thirds compositional placement.&nbsp; This photograph possesses a dynamism in how it has been composed.&nbsp; And use of a wide-angle lens to make it creates (automatically) those diagonal lines, discussed earlier, that add to its energetic impact.</p>\r\n<p>The second harbor photograph the follows takes its strength from the bold diagonal line of the foot-bridge, cutting across the frame.&nbsp; There\'s high-contrast afternoon sunlight illuminating this scene, which casts strong shadows associated with pedestrians making their way.&nbsp; The combination adds another dimension to the photo.&nbsp; But can you identify a \"subject\" amid all this - something or someone for the eyes to focus on, to come to rest on?&nbsp; Well it\'s the couple with the baby stroller, entering from the lower right corner of the frame (rule of thirds), with plenty of room to move \"into.\"&nbsp; An added element to the energy that exists in this photo is the lifted feet in motion of this couple, which adds a sense of \"moment\" to this photograph.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment7}</p>\r\n<p>Still another way to bring defining attention to a subject, is to silhouette it.&nbsp; Giving the subject more room in front (to walk \"into\") than behind, I did just this in Italian town not long ago (photo below).&nbsp; How did I do it?&nbsp; I made an exposure reading from the brightest part of the scene (the background wall), set this exposure using a shutter speed fast enough (1/250 sec) to stop the action, underexposed by one stop by adjusting my camera\'s exposure compensation dial, focused sharply on the ground where I would capture the subject and when she reached that point, I squeezed the shutter button.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment8}</p>\r\n<p>Appropriately framing an intended subject is yet another means of showcasing it within a composition.&nbsp; Not any \"frame\" will do, however.&nbsp; It needs to be thematically fitting to the subject it surrounds or partially borders.&nbsp; Take for example the two images below, the first of which was made of a sailing vessel through the rigging of the sailboard in which I was riding.&nbsp; The second photograph was made on a summer\'s day in Kazakhstan, of boys diving from a bridge into the refreshing water of a local lake.&nbsp; The photo was captured on a digital camera using a 24mm wide-angle lens to include both a background swimmer already in the water and the partial appendages of one poised to make the leap.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment9}</p>\r\n<p>{attachment10}</p>\r\n<p>The final photo example incorporates both of these techniques to showcase the subject.&nbsp; A statue of a couple locked in romantic embrace - the scene bordered by nature-esque tree branches - was silhouetted by locking in exposure from the brightest area of sky in the scene, decreasing exposure (underexposing) by one stop using the camera\'s exposure compensation control, focusing sharply on the statue and then squeezing the shutter button to make the digital capture.</p>\r\n<p>{attachment11}</p>\r\n<p>Thus are some of the ways to use both your digital camera\'s controls, combined with a working and creative knowledge of composition, to create photographs that communicate to the viewer and express precisely how you see and feel about the world around you.&nbsp; And the best advice one can give and receive - put it all into practice just as often as you can!</p>',0,4,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-08 12:46:25','2015-05-08 13:28:42');

Sept. 12) - Day Trip to Tissa Horse Festival (schedule dependent) - OR - Further Photo Exploration of Fez - Royal Palace and Historic Jewish Quarter</strong></em><br /><br />As with most of the Morocco&rsquo;s festivals, it is often difficult to pin down exact dates and details before they happen. But with date confirmed, we&rsquo;ll enjoy an early breakfast (included) and board a private van for the pleasant 40- to 50-minute drive to Tissa, a small town set amid fields, farmland and hills. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Tissa Horse Festival relives with its fantasia, Morocco\'s rich and often war-like history.&nbsp; The equestrian performance brings together competing groups of riders wearing traditional dress and carrying traditional rifles, who stage themselves in a long, single row to charge at full gallop across an open field, in single formation.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the field&rsquo;s end, all halt abruptly in unison and simultaneously fire their guns in the air.&nbsp; The team doing this the best is awarded prize money at the end of the five-day festival event.&nbsp; The festival and fantasia event offer a very special photo opportunity filled with pageantry, color and excitement!<br />Should the Tissa Festival not fall on this weekend, we&rsquo;ll continue our fascinating photo exploration of Fez and its various facets of activity,&nbsp; with concentration on the Royal Palace (Dar el-Makhzen) and the synagogue and surroundings of Fez&rsquo;s Jewish Quarter (Mellah).<br /><br /><em>Dar Finn Breakfast (included); Packed lunch (included if traveling to Tissa; otherwise lunch included at the Dar Finn); Dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at the Dar Finn.</em><br /><br /><strong><em>Day 4 (Sun.

Sept. 15) - Azrou Market</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Following an early Dar Finn breakfast (included), we&rsquo;ll board a private van for the hour-long trip south to the town of Azrou.&nbsp; Situated at nearly 3,940 feet (1,200 meters) in elevation and enclosed by cedar and pine forests, this important Berber market center sits at the crossroads of two major routes - north to Meknes and Fez, south to Khenifra and Midelt.&nbsp; The weekly souk draws thousands of people selling and buying vegetables, carpets, sheep, goats and cattle. It&rsquo;s photographs no matter where you turn.<br /><br />Arriving early afternoon in Fez, there will be plenty of time to relax while editing images in the comfort of Dar Finn&rsquo;s sitting room.<br /><br /><em>Dar Finn Breakfast (included); Lunch and dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at the Dar Finn.</em><br /><br /><em><strong>Day 7 (Wed. Sept. 16) - Chefchaouen</strong></em> <br /><br />Following an early breakfast (included), we board private vans for the scenic 2 1/2- to 3-hour drive to Chefchaouen.&nbsp; Tucked away in Africa&rsquo;s northernmost Rif mountain range, &ldquo;Chaouen,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s locally known, is one of the most beautiful towns in Morocco.&nbsp; An artsy, blue-washed mountain village that feels like a world unto itself. The old medina here is a rich blend of Moroccan and Andalucian influence, with red-tiled roofs, bright-blue buildings and narrow lanes converging on busy Plaza Uta el-Hammam and its restored fortress, or kasbah.&nbsp; With its rich cultural tapestry of Berber tribespeople, Muslims, Jews and descendants of 15th century Moorish exiles from Spain, Chefchaouen is a most pleasant blend of ease and traditional authenticity and one you&rsquo;ll enjoy exploring again and again, with your camera.<br /><br />Once checked into our night&rsquo;s stay, we&rsquo;ll break once again into two groups to begin our photo &ldquo;coverage&rdquo; of this enchanting town.&nbsp; Meeting up for a mint tea somewhere, perhaps, and then back to photography, again.<br /><br /><em>Lunch on our own in Chefchaouen (not included); Evening dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at Riad Dar Zambra or similar accommodation.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Day 8 (Thur. Sept 17) - Chefchaouen / PM Return to Fez</strong></em><br /><br />Following a riad breakfast (included), we&rsquo;ll venture out to photograph the town of Chefchaouen in greater detail - its markets, bazaars, wonderfully colorful buildings and walkways and its town square.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll even hike a short distance above the town to gain a panoramic perspective, from which to capture some&nbsp; &ldquo;scene-setting&rdquo; images of Chaouen in its picturesque hilly surroundings.<br /><br />In the mid-afternoon will board our vans for the ride back back down the mountain to our base in Fez.<br /><br /><em>Lunch on our own (not included); Evening dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at the Dar Finn.</em><br /><br /><em><strong>Day 9 (Fri.

Durch seine Lage zwischen Rif- und Altas- Gebirge war Fez die Stadt der kaiserlichen marokkanischen Dynastie.</p>\r\n<p>Die Altstadt von Fez, reich an Geschichte und historischer, interessanter Architektur&nbsp; besticht mit ihren engen, verwinkelten Gassen, M&auml;rkten und lebhaften, quirligen Basaren. Sie bietet eine Lebendigkeit, auch bedingt durch ein reiches Angebot an Handwerkern wie Ledergerber und F&auml;rber, Kupferschmiede und H&auml;ndler von Gem&uuml;se, Obst und exotischen Gew&uuml;rzen.

Hier verbindet sich Einfluss aus dem kulturellen Leben der Berber, der Muslime, der Juden und der Nachkommen der im 15.

But with date confirmed, we&rsquo;ll enjoy an early breakfast (included) and board a private van for the pleasant 40- to 50-minute drive to Tissa, a small town set amid fields, farmland and hills. &nbsp;<br /><br />The Tissa Horse Festival relives with its fantasia, Morocco\'s rich and often war-like history.&nbsp; The equestrian performance brings together competing groups of riders wearing traditional dress and carrying traditional rifles, who stage themselves in a long, single row to charge at full gallop across an open field, in single formation.&nbsp; At&nbsp; the field&rsquo;s end, all halt abruptly in unison and simultaneously fire their guns in the air.&nbsp; The team doing this the best is awarded prize money at the end of the five-day festival event.&nbsp; The festival and fantasia event offer a very special photo opportunity filled with pageantry, color and excitement!<br />Should the Tissa Festival not fall on this weekend, we&rsquo;ll continue our fascinating photo exploration of Fez and its various facets of activity,&nbsp; with concentration on the Royal Palace (Dar el-Makhzen) and the synagogue and surroundings of Fez&rsquo;s Jewish Quarter (Mellah).<br /><br /><em>Dar Finn Breakfast (included); Packed lunch (included if traveling to Tissa; otherwise lunch included at the Dar Finn); Dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at the Dar Finn.</em><br /><br /><strong><em>Day 4 (Sun.

It&rsquo;s photographs no matter where you turn.<br /><br />Arriving early afternoon in Fez, there will be plenty of time to relax while editing images in the comfort of Dar Finn&rsquo;s sitting room.<br /><br /><em>Dar Finn Breakfast (included); Lunch and dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at the Dar Finn.</em><br /><br /><em><strong>Day 7 (Wed. Sept. 16) - Chefchaouen</strong></em> <br /><br />Following an early breakfast (included), we board private vans for the scenic 2 1/2- to 3-hour drive to Chefchaouen.&nbsp; Tucked away in Africa&rsquo;s northernmost Rif mountain range, &ldquo;Chaouen,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s locally known, is one of the most beautiful towns in Morocco.&nbsp; An artsy, blue-washed mountain village that feels like a world unto itself. The old medina here is a rich blend of Moroccan and Andalucian influence, with red-tiled roofs, bright-blue buildings and narrow lanes converging on busy Plaza Uta el-Hammam and its restored fortress, or kasbah.&nbsp; With its rich cultural tapestry of Berber tribespeople, Muslims, Jews and descendants of 15th century Moorish exiles from Spain, Chefchaouen is a most pleasant blend of ease and traditional authenticity and one you&rsquo;ll enjoy exploring again and again, with your camera.<br /><br />Once checked into our night&rsquo;s stay, we&rsquo;ll break once again into two groups to begin our photo &ldquo;coverage&rdquo; of this enchanting town.&nbsp; Meeting up for a mint tea somewhere, perhaps, and then back to photography, again.<br /><br /><em>Lunch on our own in Chefchaouen (not included); Evening dinner on our own (not included); Overnight at Riad Dar Zambra or similar accommodation.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Day 8 (Thur.

Alles Motive f&uuml;r Fotografien, egal wo Sie sich hindrehen.</p>\r\n<p>Ankunft am fr&uuml;hen Nachmittag in Fez, dann gibt es gen&uuml;gend Zeit, um ein wenig zu entspannen, sowie die Zeit zu nutzen um die Bilder von Vormittag in dem gem&uuml;tlichen Ambiente des Wohnzimmer des Dar Fins bei einem Tee und Musik im Hintergrund nach zu bearbeiten.</p>\r\n<p><em>Dar Finn Fr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck (im Gesamtpreis enthalten), Mittagessen (im Gesamtpreis enthalten), Abendessen auf eigene Faust (im Gesamtpreis nicht enthalten), &Uuml;bernachtung im Dar Finn.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Tag 7 (Mittwoch 16.

Die alte Medina (Altstadt) besteht aus einer Mischung aus marokkanischem und andalusischen Einfluss mit roten Ziegeld&auml;chern, hellblauen Geb&auml;uden und engen Gassen, die auf die betriebsame Plaza UTA el- Hammam und sein restauriertes Fort ( oder auch Kasbah genant) f&uuml;hren. Hier verbindet sich Einfluss aus dem kulturellen Leben der Berber, der Muslime, der Juden und der Nachkommen der im 15. Jahrhundert aus Spanien kommenden Exilanten zu einer angenehmen Mischung aus Leichtigkeit und traditionellen Authentizit&auml;t. Sie werden es geniessen mittels Kamera diese Eindr&uuml;cke festzuhalten.</p>\r\n<p>Nachdem wir in unserem Guest House eingecheckt haben, werden wir&nbsp; in zwei Kleingruppen diesen Ort erkunden und unsere Eindr&uuml;cke festhalten.

Join us in this very special photography exploration of the varied cultures, landscapes and cityscapes which together make this unspoiled northern part of India so unique.</p>\r\n<p>Beginning at the city of Amritsar, the spiritual heartland of the Sikh world, we&rsquo;ll explore with the camera the grandeur of the Golden Temple by day and by night and visit the Bhaga border ceremony.</p>\r\n<p>Amid the natural beauty of <strong><a href=\"http://www.basunti-yoga-india.co.uk/other-activities/photography/\">Basunti</a></strong>, our lenses will focus on wildlife, landscapes and the agrarian-paced lifestyle of villagers in the area. Basunti is situated in a midst a wild-life sanctuary, surrounded by exquisite views of the vast waters of the Maharana Pratap Sagar and the Himalaya lower range beyond.&nbsp; Here we will have plenty of time to explore by foot, photograph, engage in evening critiques and edit our work. While at Basunti, water levels permitting, we will visit the magical Bathu Temples, which are submerged in the lake for most months of the year. If water levels are too high to enable a visit, another day trip will be offered as part of the workshop.</p>\r\n<p>Then it&rsquo;s on to McLeod Ganj, a pleasant half-day&rsquo;s scenic drive into Kangra District of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. There will be undoubtedly many stops on the way - chances to capture panoramic glimpses of the majestic Dhauladhar Range, foothills to the Greater Indian Himalayas, beyond. </p>\r\n<p>Reaching &ldquo;Little Tibet&rdquo;, as McLeod Ganj is often referred to, we&rsquo;ll base ourselves amid red-robed Buddhist monks, the Tibetan Government-in-Exile and within walking distance of His Holiness the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s private residence itself. Kind and gentle, Tibetans are some of the most congenial subjects to photograph.&nbsp; A blend of Buddhist and Hindu - ancient and modern - McLeod Ganj will provide a wealth of dynamic themes and subjects to photograph. </p>\r\n<p>Colour is intensified in clear mountain air and we&rsquo;ll be right there to bring it to photographic life with a short and leisurely journey from McLeod Ganj, up hillside paths to Dharamkot and Naddi Village.&nbsp; Gaddi is the ethnic group in this area, a people who traditionally moved semi-nomadically, crossing high passes in spring and autumn with their herds of sheep and goats.&nbsp; These days, most Gaddi families are permanent residents of the area and add interestingly to portraiture that can be gained here with just a greeting and a smile.  </p>\r\n<p>Designed for beginners and experienced photographers alike, this 12-day on-location workshop will focus on all of this, while building your skills as a travel photographer.&nbsp; Under the guidance and positive support of your instructor, you&rsquo;ll photograph on a daily basis, enjoy lively informational and inspiring critiques each evening and by workshop&rsquo;s end, you&rsquo;ll have a strong and stunning collection of work that any travel photographer would be proud to put his or her name to.  <br /> </p>','<p><strong>Our itinerary:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>  Day 1 (Tue 24 Nov) -</strong> Arrive Amritsar and transfer to <a href=\"http://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Hotel_Review-g303884-d386920-Reviews-Mrs_Bhandari_s_Guesthouse-Amritsar_Punjab.html\">Mrs Bhandari\'s Guesthouse</a>.
